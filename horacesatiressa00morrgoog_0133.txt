ἵ [The difficulty which all com·

mentatorS, beginning with the
scholiasts, have leit iu interpreting
these lines and in assiguing them
to the speakers is due, l think, to
the fact that Horace is not report-
ingthe whole conversation, but is
giving only the main points, omit-
ting, especially in 44 f, the cou-
necting liuks of the thought.
This is a favorite method with
him (ag. Sat. 1, 4, 52 ff, 854 ff,
1, 6, 17-25) and it suits perfectly
the informal style of the Sermones,
but it sometimes leaves the
thought insufficiently expressed.

sire to suggest the subjectos the

remarks and the desire to suppress
the details with their low estimate

second actor ou the stage should

signed.’—dispeream, ni: cf. the
line of Catullus, quoted above.

speech that Horace makes in the
whole conversation, as though he
felt the insinuations in 44-48 to
be unbearable without the most
earnest aud explicit (1εηί31.-
aliena: free from, but moliris,
grammatically, a dative. — in-
quam: Itell yorr,· the insertion
of this in the midst of his words
adds to the earnestuess.

5² f. Magnum . . . credibile:
the offensive incredulity betrays
the character of the speaker. —
Atqui sic habet: it’s so, anylzow.
