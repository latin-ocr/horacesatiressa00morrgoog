sonal untidiness and moral obli-
quity are part of the conventional
picture of the miser. They are
used occasionally in Sat. r, 1 (e g.
vss. 96 ff.), but always witha hu-
morous recognition of their extrav·
agance3 here the fanatical Stoic

attributes the sins cs the individua} ,

(a malefactor of great wealth) to
the whole class, as if he were us-
ing a serious argument. —si quid·
vis satis est: tle. ‘if you accept
the doctrine of philosophy that
enough is as good as a feast’ Cf.

128-141. ‘You in your senses?
Most certainly not. To be sure,
the common judgment is that

lence proves you sane? What, you
think it does? You are no Orestes,
you say, the madman who went to
Argos and killed his mother with
a* sword, tor you did the deed

without bloodshed and not in
Argos either. But it is the crime,
not the manner or the place of it,
that proves a man mad. As to
Orestes, his madness began before
his violent outbreak and in fact,
aster the act that is commonly
considered evidence os his mad·
ness, his conduct was most nor-
mal and exemplary—except a
little harmless cursing.'

129. servos tuos: a little hit
at the lover of money, who would
be quite unlikely to injure the
money-value oi his own slaves.

131. cum. . .interimis: i.e.‘ when
you are engaged in some quiet
crime, all in the family.l There is,
of course, no implication that any
such crime has been committed3
much lesS, as is generally said, that
the miser had murdered his mother
for her money. That motive is
suggested in the parallel passage,
Sar. 2, 1, 53 ff, but not here.
