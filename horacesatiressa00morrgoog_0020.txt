of his style. The longest quotation, a definition of virtus in
thirteen verses, is not without dignity oi thought and expres-
sion, but in general the criticism of Horace, that Lucilius
wrote too freely aud with too little attention to finish of style,
seems to be justified. The loss of his writings is a loss to lirr-
guistic and literary history, rather than to literature itself. But r
he performed the great service of determining both the torre and
the form of satire. He gave to it ior all time that critical arrd
censorious tone which is ¹still associated with 'the name and,
after considerable experiment with other verse forms which had
been used by Ennius, he settled upon the hexameter as the
most suitable meter. In selecting satire as ⁸his field, Horace
therefore felt himself bound by all the force of strong tradition i
to a certain tone and a certain verse.

But the force of tradition and convention in ancient literature,
strong as it waS, did not preclude originality3 it merely set the
bounds within which originality might work. Of imitation, irr
anyproper sense of me word, that is, of attempt to copy as
closely as possible the work of an older writer, there is very
little evidence in Greek or Latin literature, and Horace, setting
himself to write Lucili ritu, as he says, accepting as his starting
point the definition which Lucilius had given to satire, was
also acutely conscious of the imperfectioris of his predecessor,
and fully determined to avoid them in his own work. The
most evident oi these imperfectioris was in me matter of style
The fragments of the satires of Lucilius are bold and crude in
expression 3 they say what was to be said, but they say it with- 3
out charm. There is no evidence of care for workmanship,
of pleasure in attractive expression. 'But between Lucilius ,
and Horace was the great Ciceronian period, in which the whole
subject of Latin style in prose and in verse was most warmly
debated by men who were daily practicing the art of writing.
Two generations had contributed to raise the standard of good
style, and Horace and the friends with whom he lived were
