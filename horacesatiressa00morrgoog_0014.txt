is no record except the rather juvenile seventh satire of the

Behind these bare facts of his early life the temperament and l
character of Horace were taking shape. The story has in it ⁶
so much that is modernjhat we are perhaps in danger of forcing
» the analogieS, yet the outlines of the process are clear. Horace

was a country boy, trained in the prudent traditions of a quiet Ὗ
life ; his father desired for him the rise in station which he had ¹
himself only partially achieved, and sought it by means of a l
higher education and more stimulating associations than a re-
mote village could afford. From the studies of the university l
the young man was plunged into the floods of civil war, following ἵ
the leadership of the half-mystical and wholly romantio Brutus
He returned to Rome a pardoned rebel; the cause which he
still believed to hav'e been the cause of liberty was lost; his hopes y
of advancement in public life were at an end; his father was ,
dead, his friends scattered‚ his property gone. Obscum, disap l
Xointed, perhaps alittle embittered‚ he was to begin life over ⁴
gain. If this young man seems a different person from the Hor-
ace whom we associate with graceful love poems and the doctrine
of the golden mean, it is only because we accept the result 'l
without following the process which led to it. For the two f
are identical; there is no break in the development; indeed, 1
it is out of precisely such material that the mellow and penetrat· ’
