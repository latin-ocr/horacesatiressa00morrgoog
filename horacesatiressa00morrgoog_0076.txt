HORATI

quod moechus foret aut sicarius aut alioqui

famosus, multa cum libertate notabant

Hinc omnis pendet Lucilius, hosce secutus

mutatis tantum pedibus numerisque, facetus,

emunctae naris, durus componere versus.

Nam fuit hoc vitiosus: in hora saepe ducentoS, A
10 ut magnum, versus dictabat stans pede in uno;

1, 77, with no more difference
than there is between ‘rascals and
thieves' and ‘rascally thieves.'

5. famosus: inabad sense, the
common meaning in early Latin.
— libertate: wz'tlz the utmost free·
dom of speech. The extant plays
of Aristophanes, in which public
men are ridiculed with great li-
cense, abundantly support this
statement.

6. Hinc . . . pendet: upon tlrem
Luriltits z's entirely dependent, zze.

drama-tantum: not to be taken
too strictly, for Lucilius of course

did not use the dramatic form. '⁴

The emphasis here is upon the
satirical spirit.,-facetus: origi·
nally ‘brilliant or polished in
speech’ (from fa-ri, to speak),
and this is the meaning always

in Plautus; cf. also Sar. 1, 10, γ

44, molle alque facetum, of Ver·
gil’s bucolic poetry. The mean-
ing ίΙῐυιηοῑοιιε,1 ‘facetiouS,' comes
over into the adj. from the noun

as the context shows they were facetiae. It combines with extrunc-

⁴his predecessors and models in
the open ridicule of individuaIS,
his warrant for the use of per-

* sonal satire. It does not mean

that Roman satire, as a form of
literature, was derived from or an
imitation of Greek comedy.-c.
Lucilius: see Introd. - hosce:
= hos. ln Plautus the forms
in -ce are used only before
vowels.

7. mutatis . . . numeris: Lu-
cilius wrote partly in iambics and
trochaics, but the verse which he
used most frequently and which
became the traditional verse for
satire was the dactylic hexameter,
which is not employed in the

tae naris to express the single idea
‘keen in words aud in thought,'
‘sarcastic' The same idea is ex·

pressed in Sat. 1, 10, 3 f., sale ἲ

ratulfo urbem defricuit.
9· hoc: in θεῖε, referring to
what followS, which is at the

same time an expansion of durus r

corrtponere versus.
10. ut magnum: ‘considering it
a great feat'- stans. . . uno:

apparentlya proverbial expression ’
for doing something without effort, ⁸

but it does not occur elsewhere3
Quintilian, 12, 9, 18, in lu‘s actioni-

bus otrrni, ut agricolae dicunt, pede κ

standum est, seems to be a refer-
ence to the opposite idea.
