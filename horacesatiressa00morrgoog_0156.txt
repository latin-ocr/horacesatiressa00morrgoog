HORATI

Iuppiter, ut pereat positum robigine telum,-
nec quisquam noceat cupido mihi pacis l' At ille
45' qui me commorit (‘melius non tangere l' clamo), ί
flebit, et insignis tota cantabitur urbe.
Cervius iratus> leges minitatur et urnam,

43. ut pereat: a wish intro·
duced'by ut exactly as wishes are
introduced by attritam, which is
nothing but a strengthened form
of uti (cf. quis, qm'snam)·, in-
stances are not infrequent. The
verse is in lonn, though not in
sentiment, a reminiscence of Ca·
tull. 66, 48, Iuppiter, ut Chalybon
omne genus pereat. -- positum: a
partos the wish; ‘may 1 be able
to put it away and let it rust3'
almost the same as augme tectus.
, 44-46. ln these lines the hu·
morous exaggeration and affected
solemnity os the satire reach a
climax. Whatever Horace may
have been in his earlier years, he
was at this time as far removed as
possible from a bragging swash-
buckler‚whose war-cry (clunzo) was
‘Better not touch mel' He is, in
fact, setting up here the figure of
himself which his earlier critics had
constmcted, exaggerating it and
making it ridiculous bya burlesque
defence, in the confident assurance
that his real purpose in satire
was by this time fully recognized.
· 45. commorit: = commoverit.
There is alrind of progress in
pretended touchiness from infestis
latronibus to commorit (slir me up)
and· tangere (lay afingerffiime).

, e

4⁶1 cantabitur: im the whole
town shall be repeating th'e satiri·

cal verses that l will write about ²

him.

47-56. These lines serve a
double purpose. Asa part of
the ironical argument they pre· ’
tend to justify the determination
(44-46) to continue the writing of
satire (ί Canidia poisons her ene·
mies and lwill poison mine: the
wolf bites and therefore 1 will

write biting satire’), and they ἵ

illustrate the general principle ¹
(vss⁴ 24-28) that men are not to
be blamed sor yielding to their
special wealrnesses (⁴and satire is
my weakness,' vs. 28). At the
same time, these allusions, which
a reader of Horace's time would
at once understand, show how
harmless aad impersonal his
satire really was. F or no one
os the five persons named was ¹
really an enemy of Horace. Cer-
vius, Albucius, and Scaeva are
names which occur elsewhere
(Sat 2, 6, 77; 2, 2, 673 Epist, ι,
17, 1), but with quite different
characteristics3 they are merely
Roman names which do not refer
to individuals. Canidia is fre·
quently mentioned (Sat. 1, 83

2, 8, 953 and· 3, 83 5, 17) in
