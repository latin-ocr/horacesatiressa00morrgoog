SERMONES

sume tibi deciens; tibi tantundem3 tibi triplex,

unde uxor media currit de noete vocata)

Filius Aesopi detractam ex aure Metellae,

’ - 240 scilicet ut deciens solidum absorberet, aceto

diluit insignem bacam: qui sanior ac si

illud idem in rapidum fiumen iaceretve cloacam?

Quinti progenies Arri, par nobile fratrum,

nequitia et nugis pravorum et amore gemellum,
²45 luscinias soliti' impenso prandere coemptas,

³ quorsum abeant? Sanin' creta, an carbone notandi?

Aedificare casas, plostello adiungere mures,

238. under = a quo. - Notice
again the abrupt ending of one
story and beginning of another,

239. Aesopi: a distinguished
actor of Cicero’s time, of whose
follies some reports have come
down to us. He left to his son,
however, a large fortune and a
taste for extravagance.—Metel-
lae: probably the wife of Cor-
nelius Lentulus Spinther, several

. times referred to in Cicero's

letters.

240. solidum: agreeing with
dect'ens as a substantive ; ‘a whole
million,' somewhat as we say ‘a
lump sum’ —This story is also
connected with Antony and Cleo-
patra. But pearls do not dissolve
in wine or vinegar.

243. Ani: cf. vs. 86 and note.

“ -par nobilefratrumzoften quoted
as if nobile meant noble and were
used here ironically. lt is the not
infrequent use of nobilis in pre-
cisely the sense of notus, with

uon. sar. - 13

either a good or a bad sense,
here notorious.

244i. pravorum: with amore.
—gemellum agreeing with par,
but to be rendered freely—im-
penso: at vast expense. Stories
quite incredible have come down·
to us of the eost of a single night·
iugale.

246. quorsum abeant: into
wltz'clz class shall rho be put?-
creta‚ carbone: so albus et oter,
Epist. 2, 2, 189, and albus on ater
homo, Catull. 93, 2. All these are
merely expressions of the natural
association of black with evil and
white with good. For complete-
ness insani would be used with
carbone, but it is unnecessary to
supply it.

247-280. The madness of lovers.
This subject is not announced in
the introduction (vss. 77-81)‚ but
may be considered to be included
under the third heading, the pas-
sion for luxury.
