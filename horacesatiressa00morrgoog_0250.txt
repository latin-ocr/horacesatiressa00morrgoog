2, 8, 1] > HORATI

But though the setting and the details are pure burlesque, there is ,
a certain amount of serious purpose underneath, as in Sat. 2, 3, ior
example, where the Stoic is burlesqued, but the iollies of mankind are
also satirized. The host at the banquet, who is here ridiculed on his y
lighter side, is a type of the same man who is attached with savage
directness in Epod. 4, the man of low station and no culture, whose ¹
suddenly acquired wealth has not changed his nature. He is repre·
sented here as an aspiring epicure, proud of his knowledge of the art ,
oi cookery and secking to advance his acquaintance with Maecenas by
giving him a particularly fine dinner. But the ridicule is directed quite ¹
as much, perhaps even more, against the absurd solemnities of the
epicure. There are passages (vss. 6 ff, 43 ff, especially 85 ff.) which Ἴ
are indistinguishable in tone and manner srom parts of Sat. 2, 4, and
which have no point at all unless we understand them as we do that 2
satire, —as ironical parodies of the precepts of fine cookery.

This is not one oi the best of the satires. The humor is not always
in good taste3 there is too close an approach to horse-play and, though k
Maecenas and the literary men are kept in the background, with the ⁴
evident purpose of guarding their dignity, the rest oi the guests are not .
superior in good-breeding to the host whom they ridicule. The scene
is, with some differences, not unlike the supper described in Sat. 1, 5,
51 ff. and, in general, this satire has many of the characteristics, both
positive and negative, of Sat. 1, 5. The explanation is that Horace is
here also, as in 1, 5, following a satire of Lucilius (Charis. in Gr. Lat. t
p. 100 K, Lucilius . . . deridens rusticam cenam,⁴ the fragments are
in Marx, 193 ff.), doubtless improving upon the form, but hampered by q
his model. The grave and sustained irony of Sat. 2,4,when no Lu· ⁴
cilian influence is discernible, is much superior to this. i
