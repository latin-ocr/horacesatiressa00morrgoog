HORATI ⁴

porrectus vigilet cum longo fuste, neq‘ue illinc
audeat esuriens dominus contingere granum,
ac potius foliis parcus vescatur amaris ;
115 si positis intus'chii veterisque Falerni »
mille cadis — nihil e'st, tercentum milibusu— acre
potet acetum ; age, si et stramentis incubet, unde-g
octoginta annos natus, cui stragulavestis,
blattarum ac tinearum epulae, putrescat in arca: ·
120 nimirum insanus paucis videatur, eo quod
maxima pars hominum morbo iactatur eodem.
Filius aut etiam haec libertus ut ebibat heres,

Quantulum enim summae curtabit quisque dierum,

is folly—is much like parts os
Sar. ι, ι. ln order to maintain
the Stoic tone, the details are
carried out to the point of extrav-
agance (114, 116, 125), but the
underlying idea is so distinctly
Horace's own that the fiction of
the Stoic preacher is almost for·
gotten.

112. porrectus vigilet: cf. in-

edly instead of multis or orrmibrrr,
to preserve the Stoic doctrine that
only the sapiens is sane.

121: iactatur: of the tossing ,

122. libertus: the wretched con·
dition ol the old miser is increased
by the suggestion (more fully ex·
pressed in Sat. 1, 1, 80 ff.) that he

has alienated his natural heirs. — 1

ebibat: with special reference tothe
preceding illustration, vss. 115-
117, though of course with general
application to 111 ff. and 117 ff.
The same thought was afterward
more effectively expressed by
Horace in Carm. 2, 14, 25 ff.

123. disinimice: Godforsakcn.

sense cf. vs. 84— quisque dierum:
