T ir. Quando pauperiem, missis ambagibus, horreS, ¹
accipe qua ratione queas ditescere. Turdus
sive aliud privum dabitur tibi, devolet illuc
res ubi magna nitet domino sene; dulcia poma
et quoscumque ieret cultus tibilundus honores,
ante larem gustet venerabilior lare dives3

sanguine fraterno, fugitivus, ne tamen illi

Vlz'r. the tegam spurco Damae latus? Haud ita

erence to the sea-beaten Odys·
sens-The sentiment ol the
line is, of course, intentionally
unheroic.

9. missis ambagibus: without
any pretence, in plain words.

rofi. Turdus: cf. Sat. 1, 5, 72.—
privum: fer your own,· pred.with
dabitur. The fact that it was the
special property of the giver will
add to its value in the eyes of the
meeber-devolet: with humor-
ous effect, in both literal and
figurative meaning-nitet: fleur·
rsltes3 ele. be sure that the prop·
erty is large and uuincumbered. —
The abrupt beginning and the
rather obscure expression is a par·
ody of the ordinary style of proph-
ecy, obscuris vera involvens (Aen.
6,100).

13. honores: fruits and flowers,
as in Carm. 1, 17, 16.

14. ante larem: the first-fruits
were properly offered to the Lar
Familiares.

15. sine gente: of no farnily3 a
freedman or a slave had no legal
claim to be gentiles. There is no
necessary connection with fiagiti-
vus, since no definite person is in
mind3 the various discreditable
attributes are piled together, as
in Carm. 2, 13, 5 ff.; Eped. 3,
rs.

17. comes exterior: ‘to escort -
him, walking on his left side’; 2
this is expressed in the next line ,

by tegnam . . . latus. lt was the

Greek and the Roman custom lor ,

the inferior, as escort, to walk on
the left side. The explanation
given was that the left side was

more open to attach, the right t
being protected by the drawn ¹

sword.-si postulet: in the collo ·

quial sense ol postulare, to expect,
desire.

18. the tegam: acommon form
of repudiating exclamation. -Da

mae: a common name of a slave; ·

cf. Sat. 1, 6, 38.
