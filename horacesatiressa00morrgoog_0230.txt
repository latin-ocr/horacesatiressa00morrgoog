unde homines operum primos vitaeque labores
instituunt (sic dis placitum), tu carminis esto
principium. Romae sponsorem arne rapis. ‘Heia,

it was customary in ritual to ad·
dress the divinity by several differ-
ent names, leaving it to him to
select, as it were, the most accept·
able (libentr'rts); cf. Corm. Sacc.
15 f., stoc tu Lucina probas vocari
(= libentius andri) seu Genztalts.
The vocative is used as a direct
quotation from the prayer.—audis ι
art called3 so respue paterque
nuduli, Epist. 1, 7, 37 l„ and often.
-unde: : a quo, ‘with an invo-
cation to whom.'—ln the rather
heavy phrases—operum vt'toeque
labores, instituunt, sic dis placitum

to be rid of the annoyances. lt is
annoying to have to go to court
on acold day, bnt it would be
still more annoying to feel that

through the crowd and give just ¹

which follow, lzeia . . . urge.

the sun sinks lower in approaching
the winter solstice‚ each daily
circle seems to be within that of
the preceding day.
