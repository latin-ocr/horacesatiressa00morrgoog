and his friends.

' 72. stilum vertas: the blunt

upper end of the sttlus was used to

smooth out tbe marks made in the

wax of a tablet, as a lead-pencil is

reversed to use the eraser.

73. scripturus: with the effect
osacondition3 if you lupe to write.

74. contentus: continuing the
advice: but lc content with.

75. vilibus.. . dictari: poetry
to be learned was dictated by the
teacber and taken down by the
pupils. So Orbilius dictated
Livius Andronicus to Horace,
Epist. 2, 1, 70 f. and Vergil and
Horace were in the curriculum of
schools in the time os Juvenal
(7, 226 f.). Horace, of course, did

78. cimex: as this is not used
by us as a term of reproach, a
modern equivalent, least, reptile,
may be substituted. - Pantilius:
unknown; but tlre name actually
occurs and there is no good
reason for connecting it with
πᾶν τίλλειν or supposing it to be
ilduinus-cruciet: the subj. is
quod vellicet.

79 ff. Demetrius is unknown;
cf. vs. 18. Most of the other
names in this list have been meu-
tioned before: Fannius, 1, 4, 21 ;
Hermogenes, 1, 3, 43 Plotius, 1,
5,4o; Varius, r, 5, 403 Fuscus, r,
9, 61 ; Viscus, r, 9, 223 Pollio, vs.

others, C. Valgius Rufus was an
