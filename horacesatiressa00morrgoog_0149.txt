LIBER SECVNDVS

’ The Second Book of the Satires was published in 30 nc, five years
after the First Book, and the changes which the interval had produced
in the temper and in the art of Horace are quite evident; his tone is
less personal and more mellow and he has adopted the dialogue form
instead of the monologue. In both respects the change is an advance.

. The earlier satireS, with all their geniality, are touched here and there

with sensationalism, and even the later work betrays at times a certain
uneasiness about his own position and Success. But by the year 30
mc. Horace, now about thirty-five years of age, had won recognition asa
writer. He was secure in the esteem of a circle of friends ; he had accom-
modated himself, not indeed without difficulty, but quite sincerely, to

· the great politica] changes which he had at first opposed, and he writes

like a man at peace with himself and with his world. He is not less
serious; in his treatment of philosophy he is more serious3 but he is

Α less insistent, less urgent, and his touch is lighter. With this changein

tone the change in form, from monologue to dialogue, and especially to a
dialogue in which Horace himself plays onlya subordinate part, is quite
in harmony. A tendency toward informal dialogue is evident in some

¹ of the satires of the First Book (eg, 1, 1, 30 ff.; 1, 4, 38 ff), but the step

l

from this to the formal dialogue of 2, r and 2, 5 is a long one,·and the
change was undoubtedly regarded by Horace as a distinct advance in
the form of satire.

tion. The reference to the Parthians (vs. 13) is entirely general and
might have been made before the battle of Actium, while Antonius was
still master of the East. But itis probable that this satire was written
after the rest of the book was completed, in accordance with the custom
which Horace had begun in Sat. 1, 1 and which he afterward followed
in Epad. 1, 1, Carm. 1, 1, and Epist. 1, ι. This would fix the date about
30 ac, after the battle of Actium, to which Caesaris ravicti (vs. 11)

may be an allusion. ’
