305 Hor. Stultum me fateor (liceat concedere veris),

302. videor mihi sanus: tle.
under the cover of asking for his
particular form of insanity Horace
is really implying that he is not
insane at all. Damasippus goes
straight to the point.

303 f. The story is told in the
BacchaeofEuripides,whereAgave,
the mother of PentheuS, appears,
carrying the head of her son, whom
she and the other Bacchantes have

torn to pieceS, mistaking him in ‘
, their frenzy for an animal. The

argument is that, as no madman
recognizes his condition, such a
statement as videor mihi sanus
proves nothing.

305 f. Horace represents himself
as yieplding to the Stoic's argument,
as indeed he must, but he does it

' grudgingly, at first admitting only

the milder stultus and then at
last making full submission in
atque etiam thronum—liceat:
let mc yz'eld to facts, tle. ‘permit
me to yield as 'gratefully as Ι can’

30⁶· edissere: a rather formal

word, Tell mefully. The question
quo . . . vt'tio? repeats qua ne ’
stultitia. . . putas? in different
words and with much less confi-
dence that the Stoic will find it
a difficult question to answer.
307 ff. primum: as if there was
to be a series of charges-aedifi-
cas: this must be a reference to
some building operations on Hor-
ace's farm. See introd. to this
satire-longos: big prople, ae.
the rich, but the word is selected·
forits double meaning. The Vita
of Suetonius says ‘Horatius . . .
habitu corporis fuit brevis atque
obesus’ and he speaks of himself
as corporiseargm' (Epist. 1, 20, 24).
-bipedalis: of course ironical,
as if he had said‘you who are little
better than a dwarf in comparison
with really big pcople like Mae·
cenas.’-irlemz with restrictive or
adversative force, as often, cf. vs.
279. Translate, in spite oftlzat or
and yet you. —Turbonis: agladi-
ator of small size, but great spirit·
