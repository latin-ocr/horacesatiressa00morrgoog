other satires, however, the framework is in dialogue, generally very ,

skilfully adapted to its special purpose, while here the setting is not

clearly conceived (cf. vs. 7 note), the introduction is too brief (vss. 2 f.)‚ '

and the quotation passes from indirect to direct without 'sufficient mo·
tive and with a second and superfluous introduction (vss.112·115).
ln the main discourse also there is a similar lack of clearness of outline.
The change from the plural (vss. 1-7) to the vague tu breaks the con·
tinuity. The reference to Ofellus in vs. 53 is not distinct enough to
preserve the illusion of quotation. The knowledge of places, fashlons,

and persons in Rome is quite inconsistent with the circumstances of an ·‘

Apulian peasant; this is in part to be explained by the fact that the
whole satire is a parody of a Stoic sermon, in which allusions to Roman
affairs would be quite in place, but the inconsistency remains and adds

nothing to the humor. The explanation of these incongruities in struc- ’

ture is that Horace is here experimenting with a form of satire which is
a compromise between the dialogue form of Satires 3, 4. 7, and 8 and the
frankly personal monologue of Satire 6, and is inferior to either.

There is a similar compromise or combination in the subject-martem ⁴

on the one hand, the satire contrasts country life with the life of the
city, as is done in greater fulness and with greater effectiveness in
Satire 63 on the other hand, the luxuries and fashions of the table,
which are ridiculed here, are treated more fully and more humorously in
Satires 4 and 8. But the two subjects harmonize more easily than

the two forms. The combination, however, is marked enough to sug-·

gest the hypothesis that this satire is the earliest of the book in date of
composition, and that both form and subject were worked out to greater
perfectiori in the later satires.
