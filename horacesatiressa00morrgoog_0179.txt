SERMONES

callidus huic signo ponebam milia centum;
hortos egregiasque domos mercarier unus

cum lucro nora ; unde frequentia Mercuriale
imposuere mihi cognomen compita. Hor. Novi,
et miror morbi purgatum te illius. Dum. Atqui
emovit veterem mire novus, ut solet, in cor
traiecto lateris miseri capitisve dolere,

ut lethargicus hic cum fit pugil et medicum urget.

the artistic work, were evidence
to the collector of the antiquity
of the piece and, therefore, in his
eyes‚· ol its rarity and value.

23. hnic signo: srrclr a statue.
-milia centum: tle. the large

¹ ’ price which its age would com-

1

mand in the market.

24-26. unus cum lucro: in spite
of his bankruptcy and his adoption
of the life of a philosopher, Dama·
sippus cannot refrain from speaking
with pride of his earlier successes
in business. -frequentia . . . com·
pita: the crowds that gathered at

ι the street-comers, where statuary

and bronzes were sold at auction.
-Mercuriale . . . cognomen: sa·
verite of Marcum, the god of
trade (rrrerx). But Mercuriales
viri (Carm. 2, 17, 29 f.) means

. the favorites ol Mercury as the

god of speech.

²7· morbi: Horace jokingly
uses the technical term morbus,
a translation of nddoawhich was
used to describe any form of pas-
sion or any departure from calm
philosophie reason.

2⁸·30· mire: this repeats miror

in a kind of unintentional pun.
Horace had used miror with irony
—‘a surprising cure'3 Damasip-
pus in his well-meaning eagerness
overlooks the irony and uses mire
in the better sense: ⁶0h, but
the wonderful thing is not the
cure3 it is this new interest, which
effected the cure, that is so won
de1·ful.' But it is scarcely possible
to explain in the same way, as due
to the blundering eagerness of Da·
masippus, the comparison of Stoi-
cism to a morbus, even to a kind
of frenzy. Though Horace has
not actually put the word into the
mouth of Damasippus the expres-
sion is still quite clearly incon-
sistent with his character, and we
must say that Horace has here, as
perhaps in vss. 19 and 33, failed
to make the speech quite con·
sistent with the character of the
speaker.—The illustration in vs.
30-‘as some man (hic) in a
lethargy suddenly turns boxer
and assaults his doctor'—is
chosen in order to give an open·
ing for the remark in vs. 31 and to
lead up to the subject of madness.
