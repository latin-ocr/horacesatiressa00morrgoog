SERMONES

[a 5, 27

me gessi, certans semper melioribus. Tz'r. Ergo
pauper eris. Vlz'x. Fortem hoc animum tolerare iubebo ;

et quondam maiora tuli.

Tu protinus, unde

divitias aerisque ruam dic, augur, acervos.

T ir. Dixi equidem et dico: captes astutus ubique
testamenta senum, neu, si vafer unus et alter
insidiatorem praeroso fugerit hamo, 1

aut spem deponas aut artem illusus omittas. ·
Magna minorve foro si res certabitur olim,

ις. melioribus: dat.; the phrase
appears to bea reminiscence of ll.
¹> 21, 486, κρείσσοσιν μάχεσθαι and
means ‘with men of the better
class‚' Achilles and Ajax.-Ergo:
well, tlten.

20 f. A translation of the words
with which Odysseus encourages
himself before the slaughter of the
suitors, Od. 20, 18: τέτλαθι δὴ,
κραδίη· καὶ κύντερον ἄλλο ποτ’
ἔτλης. The point of the quota·

⁸ tion here is that the hero is en-

couraging himself to endure a
humiliation (hoc means cantes . . .
tre) in order to make money.
Cf. the similar remark in Sat. 1,
9, 59 f., nil sine magno vita labore
dedit mortalibus.

τι. protinus: go abead and tell
me. The completeness of the

. ‚ surrender of the heroic pose is
’ emphasized by the moment of

indignant repudiation.
ατ. ruam: transitive, in a
vaguely poetic use; ruslz together,

κ qrrr'ckly collect-augur: with in·

‘ tentional Roman coloring.
23. Dixi . . . et dicu: he had

not, in fact, said anything that
was really intelligihle, vss. 10-17
being obscure and having no ap-
parent bearing on the getting of
money. But it all seemed plain
to the prophet, and he there·
fore speaks here with, some im-
patience and then goes on to
put it in words as plain as a
prophet can use; captes . . .
testamenta.

25. praerosoz ric. nibbles off
the bait and gets away. The fig-
ure is suggested in captes and
carried on·to greater distinctness
in praeroso danao.

26. artem: te. the ars cap-
tandi, ars piscandi. ln so faras
this hints at a profession of leg-
acy-hunting, it is like our speaking
of the profession of burglary or
wire-pulling. -illusus: ‘because
you have failed once!

27. minorve: added as an after-
thought, ‘an important case —or
even one that is not so important,’
for the diligent man allows nothing
to escape him-olim: sometime3
of the future, as often.
