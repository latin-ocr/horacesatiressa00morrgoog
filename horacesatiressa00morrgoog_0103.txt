¹ such an education as a knight ora senator might have given to his

not deterred by the fear of educating me above my station. l should l
be mad to ‘wish that l had had a different father. l will not even say,

for one who had sat in the curule chair and worn the purple.
‘Fon after all,l prefer my quiet life. No bother about money, no ,

This satire belongs in subject and treatment with the third, the

. fourth, and the tenth. lt springs directly out of the circumstances of
Horace's life at the time it was written and marks another step in his

y progress from the earlier years of rebellious obscurity to the assured

· position of the Second Book. His friendship with men of rank, his
acceptance by Maecenas, and, in particular, the publication of the
account of the journey to Brundisium had revived the old criticisms
which his position in the army of Brutus had aroused and had given
new grounds for suspecting him of social and politica] ambitions. The

a satire is in form a disclaimer of such ambitions, while in substance it is
a defence os the friends who had accorded him social recognition and a
very manly and dignified declaration of pride in his father's wisdom and
of contentment with his own quiet life.
