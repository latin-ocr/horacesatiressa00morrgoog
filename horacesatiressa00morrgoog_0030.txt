unsatisfied to the end.
‘Enough of sermonizing. l'm no Crispinus!
The subject of this introductory satire is the race for wealth. In the ι
” universal peace which followed the civil warS, the finaucial affairs-of the ’
world centered at Rome as an imperial clearing house, and great for· k
tunes were rapidly made by men of the capitalist class. In general, the t
old nobility and the philosophers and writers kept aloof from business .
which consequently fell into the hands of the equz'tes, who had had only
light part in public affairS, or of the freedmen, who were ill-fitted by
racter and experience to make a large-minded or even a rational use
their money. Some of them burst out into ridiculous display, and r
furnished easy material for the satirist3 others, with less obvious folly, 1
knew no better use of their acquired wealth than to make it the means ·
of acquiring still more. Itis to men of the latter class that this dis· i

course is addressed. E or this is not pure sat‘ e, holding up the pecul- ·
iarities of certain men to the scorn of ofhe‘rffit is, in part, a discourse,
a sermon, addressed directly to the over-eager man of business, and
intended to show to him, for his possible betterment, the intrinsic little· ¹
ness of the occupation to which he was so ardently devoting himself.

Horace frequently employs in other places the thoughts and some-

times the figures and expressions of this satire· Compare especially l
the end of Epode 1, the main thought of Epode 2, and the whole of ,
Epode 4. The similarity between the social structure of the Augustan Ι
Age and our own times could scarcely be made more vivid than it is by ,
the fact that the satirist of that society chose for the theme of his open· i

ing satire the race for wealth.
