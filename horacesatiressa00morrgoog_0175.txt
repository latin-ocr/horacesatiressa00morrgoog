· sermones ’ [2, 3

(vs. 5) fixes the time of year when the dialogue is supposed to take
place, but indicates nothing in regard to the time when it was composed.

ln structure this is the most carefully arranged of all the satires. The
main body is a sermon by the philosopher Stertinius (alluded to in Epist.
1,12,20, but otherwise unknown to us) upon the Stoic Paradox mis

. ἄφρων μαίνεται, that all men except the Stoic philosopher are mad.

The discourse is carefully divided into four parts, taking up in turn the
avaricious (82-157)‚lhe ambitious (158-223), the sels-indulgent‘(224-
246, with aspecial subdivision, 247-280, for the amorous), and the super-

. stitious (281-295). There *is a brief introduction (77-81) and a

corresponding conclusion (296-299). This discourse is repeated to

Horace by Damasippus, a recent convert to Stoicism, whose character ,

and circumstances are admirably adapted to his part. He had been a

¹ collector of antique bronzes and a dealer in real estate and is alluded ⁸

to by Cicero (ad Fam. 7, 23, 2; ad Art. 1229, ²3 12, 33, r) in connec-
tion with the purchase of statuary and of land for gardens. But he had
afterward failed in business and in his despair was about to throw him-

* self into the Tiber, when he was saved by the intervention of Stertinius.

The logical reasoning by which Stertinius convinced him that his mo-
tive for suicide uras insufficient is an excellent bit of philosophical fool-
ing and serves as an introduction to the main sermon.

The circumstances which brought Dimasippus into contact with
Horace are disclosed ina brief introductory dialogue (1-31). Horace
represents himself as having gone out to his quiet Sabine farm at the
time of the Saturnalia to escape the Christmas festivities and todo some
work. But the work had been postponed and he was sitting in his

“ study dozing after a good dinner (win' solimique benignus), when

Damasippus burst in upon him, uninvited, having come out from the
city full of zeal to ronse him from his laziness. To his exhortations
Horace replies with good-natured irony in a rather superior tone and
finally submits to a recital of the long sermon. When it is over (300-
326), he rouses himself to make further ironical remarks to which
Damasippus replies with such point that Horace for a moment loses bis

temper and then surrenders, acknowledging himself to be as great a

. madman-almost-as his visitor. The opening and the closing bits
of dialogue thus form a framework for the main body of the satire. ·
Το the carefulness in construction an equal care in expression has
been added. There are few passages where the thought is not clearly
expressed and there are many of special excellence, like the farcical
scene from the camp before Troy (187-207), a forerunner of Sat. 2, 5,
or the brilliant paraphrase of the first lines of the Eunuchus (262-271).
