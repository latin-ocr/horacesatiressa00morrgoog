SERMONES [1, 3

my faults are as bad as his.” No, you do not, and your sels-satisfied
attitude is a proper subject for a satire.

‘Your habit of criticism brings its natural result, that others criticize
you, and both you and they, seizing upon some trifling fault, fail to see
the finer and nobler qualities and, still worse, make no effort to correct
your own faults.

‘I wish that we might rather be as blind to the faults of a friend as
a lover is to the defects in the face of his mistress or, if see them we
must, might treat thern with the indulgent tenderness of a father toward

‚ his child, interpreting bluntness as frankness and ahot temper as only
an excess of high spirit.

‘But we follow just the opposite course and turn good qualities into
faults, modesty into stupidity, prudence into trickiness. A fairer judg·
ment would show us that virtues are more common than vices and
would teach us to exchange pardon rather than censure.

‘A reasonable philosophy fora world of faulty men should not be
over-strict. To break a friendship for some trilling breach of good
manners is' to lose all sense of proportion between crime and penalty.

‘The Stoics, to be sure, teach in their paradoxical way that all faults
are sins and deserve the heaviest penalty. But this doctrine is repug-
nant to our best feelings and opposed to all that we know of the gradual
evolution of the moral code. A real understanding of the source of our
moral sense makes it unreasonable to punish the slightest error with
death, as-the Stoic says he would do, if he were king. “And how
now, my Stoic friend? Wishing that you were king? l thought
another of your Paradoxes proved that you are a king already.” “N 0,

ι n0, you don't understand. That means a potential king, not a king

⁴ desac10.'’ “Potential? What's that?'’ “ Why, like Hermogenes,
who doesn’t need to be singing all the time to prove that he's a singer.
Even when he isn't singing, he's a potential singer. In the same-
way I'm a king, potentially.'’ “Very well, l won't argue with you, but
l don't think much of Your Majesty, hustled by street boys on your

¹ way to the cheap baths. l will remain a private citizen and forgive as
'l hope to be forgiven.''’

' lt is not probable that the subject of this satire was suggested by
any particular set of circumstances. Roman society was censorious,
and Horace was himself an object of criticism, but this is neither a
satire, in the proper sense, nor an argument in sels-defence. lt is a
broadly human ‚plea for generosity toward one's friends. The treat-
ment of the Stolos is not to be taken seriously, and it would not be fair
to press too far the obvious modern analogias.
