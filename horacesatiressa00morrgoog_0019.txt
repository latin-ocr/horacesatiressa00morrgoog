lN'l'RODUCTlON

humorously detailed descriptions and travesties in the Second
Book make the followers of this particular mania more promi-
nent than they actually were in Roman lil . But certainly the
society to which Horace’s friendship with Maecenas gave him
access was a highly complex society, one which brought before
his observant eye a most interesting variety ol types and ol in-
. dividuam and invited good-humored comment and even caustic
remark. The Satires are not the result ol so mechanical a
choice as Horace jokingly implies, but the inevitable expression
of the reflections ol such a man as Horace was upon such a
society as that of the Augustan Age.

The form which Horace’s commentary on life was to take
was already determined ·for him. In thri respect ancient
literature was to a high degree conventional and traditional;
when once the type was fixed by the influence ol some great
originator‚ the range ol subsequent deviation from the type was
small. Didactic poetry was written in hexameters from Hesiod
to Ovid3 innovator as Euripides waS, his variations from the
norm of tragedy are in reality slight. Form and content are
identified under one name in the iambi of Archilochus, The
form of Roman satire, or at least the prevalent form, was fixed
by C. [ΨΜ He was an eques of the period of the Gracchi
and the younger Scipio Africanus, a man ol education and rank,
, a conservative in politic5‚ and a writer oi force and courage.
Ι His range of subjects was not very different hom that of Horace,
—literary crinc''i's'1ii‚ ethical discussion, social comment—but
a large place was occupied by political satire, which was almost
inevitable in that stormy period and in the writings ol a friend
of Scipio. In tone he was so lar as can be judged from the
extant fragments and from the statements ol his successors,
extremely personal and harsh. The fact that the fragments of
his writings have come down largely in quotations by the gram·
marianS, who were interested chiefly in unusual words or
phrases makes it difficult to form an independent judgment
