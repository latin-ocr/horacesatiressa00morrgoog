HORATI

noctem cum facibus! Numquid Pomponius istis
audiret leviora, pater si viveret? Ergo

non satis est puris versum perscribere verbis,
quem si dissolvas, quissstomaehfflur‚eodem

- quo« personatus pacto p ers

His, ego quae nunc,

olim quac scripsit Lucilius, eripiias si
tempora certa modosque, et quod prius ordine verbum l
est ’
posterius facias, praeponens ultima primii,>
60 non, ut si solvas ‘Postquam Discordia taetr ’
belli ferratos postis portasque refregit,'
invenias etiam disiecti membra poetae.

Ι52. Pomponius: a name is used
to point the retort, but it is quite
unlikely that it refers to any defi-
nite person. -istis: ‘the kind of
talk you have just been describ-
lng.'—The argument is that the
acer spiritus ac vis of comedy is
merely the anger that any father
in real lite might express and is
wholly different from the inspired
imagination of the poet.

54. puris. . ‚verbist in plaia
cveryday language3 the sameas
sermo meras and the opposite of
as magna sanaturum.

56. personatus . . . pater: tlte
father an rae stage, the paler ar-
dens of vs. 48. Masks (personae)
were worn by actors in comedy in
the time os Cicero—his: neut,
dat. aster eripias.

58-59. tempora certa modosque:
the fixed quantitas aad rhythms
which make the hexameter. —quod
prius. . . primis: ia. change the

words from the order demanded
hythe versification to the order of
prose.

6042, non: with invenias.-
etiam: with dissecti. The true
poet would be a poet still, even
though torn limb from limb.
There is a side reference to the
story of Orpheus—Postquam· . .
refregit ε a quotation from the An·
nales of Ennius3 cf. Verg. Aen.

7, 622, belli ferratas rupit Satur· ,2

aia postes. The thought might
have been expressed in plain prose
by postquam ballam coortum est ,-
for this unadorncd statement the
poet has substituted the imagina-
tive figure of Discord bursting
open the gates of Janus and in

the brief description has used, ⁸

almost to excesS, words charged
with poetic suggestion, taetra, fer·
ratas, pastis portasque. The two
essential qualities of poetry, mens
divinior and as taragna sanaturum,
