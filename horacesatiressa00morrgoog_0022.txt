INTRODUCHON

Still others, men ot Horace's day, were in their lifetime al-
ready so much the subject of open gossip and comment that
an''allusion''tothem was no more properly offensive or, indeed,
personal, than an allusion in a modern newspaper to the men
whose names are upon everybody's lips. Many names are Ι
fictitiouS, some pure inventions like the names in a novel, y
offis-disguising an allusion to a real person. The residuum
ι of actual personality‚ such as would be offensive to modern
feeling, is extremely small. Direct attack upon an individual
was, in fact, as little to Horace's taste as to our own, and
was incompatible with the lightness of touch which he was l
endeavoring to attain. Even tlie‘semhlance of severity, which i
the Lucilian tradition obliged him to maintain in his earlier l
work, grows less distinct as he becomes conscious of his pe·. l
culiar powers. The Second Book has less ol it thau the First 3
indeed, the first satire of that book is a kind of travesty of
the severely personal satire and, by implication, a renuncia-
‘tion of it. The place of Horace in the history of Roman
satire is, it is true, in the line of succession from Lucilius, t
but his own contribution to that history amounts almost to y
the creation of a new literary genre, a new variety of satire.

The events in the life of Horace after the publication of the
Epodes and the Second Book Q nc. are of interest to the
reader of the Satires only in so far as they interpret his earlier
period. He turned at once from satire to lyrie poetry, following l
still further the path upon which he had entered in the Epodes,
and published in 23 rac. the first three books of the odes, to
which he gave the best of his powers and the best years ol his l
lite. Aside from other and more determining motives,—the ’
inner impulse and the fact that the lyric is a higher form of art
than satire—the choice doubtless indicates also a feeling that l
he had for the time exhausted the field of satire, that he had ²

carried his modifications of the Lucilian type as far as it was ,
possible for him to carry them. But the habit of observation 1
