Romans used very freely, is often
alluded to in descriptions of the

are daazled, of course in a figura·
tive sense, ‘the judgment is dis·
tracted.’

7. hic impransi: here, not at
‚a table, and siasting, tungry, not
after an elaborate dinner. The
two words seem'to suggest a par-
ticular scene and certain definite
³ circumstances-agroup of friends

first is left without a formal apod-
osis, but pete is the apodosis to
the second. Then as the formal
stmcture of the sentence has been
disturbed, the substance of 9-13 is
condensed into cum . . . extuderit
