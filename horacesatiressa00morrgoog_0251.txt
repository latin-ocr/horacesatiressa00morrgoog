SERMONES

[2, 8, 8

de medio potare die. Fundanius. Sic, ut mihi num-

quam
in vita fuerit melius. Hor. Da, si grave nonest,
quae prima iratum ventrem placaverit esca.
Fund. In primis Lucanus aper leni fuit Austro
captus, ut aiebat cenae pater, acria circum
rapula, lactucae, radices qualia lassum

comedy. - heri: the pronuncia-
tion of the last letter was so

, indistinct that the word was writ-

' ten sometimes lteri, sometimes
ltere.
3. de medio die: the dinnerhe-

' gan before the usual hour, which

was three o'clock or later, as it
was to be a formal affair. The
Roman custom in this respect
was the opposite os ours.

4. fuerit melius : nu'lzi bene est,
“ ‘l am enjoying myselss' is a com-

, mon colloquialism3 cf. Sat. 2, 2,

120.

5. iratum ventrem: cf. latran-
tem stomachum, Sal. 2, 2, 18. The
question is ironical‚ as if the object
of a formal dinner was to satisiy

e anatural hunger.

6—9. Our knowledge of Roman
dinner customs is imperfect, the

¹ fashions changed from time to

time, and this description is meant
to he only a series oi allusions.
Itis therefore quite impossible to
³ arrange the metm or even to de-
cide whether this course consti-
tuted the gustato (protnitlsis) ς the
relishes served with the boar would ·

' indicate that it did; the fact that

no drink (mulsum) is mentioned
would, however, be a strange
omission.

of. leni. . .Austro captus: not
predicate with fuitr ‘one of the
first things was a Lucanian boar,
killed, as the host said, when a
mild southerly wind was blowing.'
The Lucanian boar was especially
prized and the state of the westher
at e time the animal was killed
was upposed to affect the flavor
of the meat3 cf. Sat. 2, 2, 32 ff.
and the modern superstitious
about the ‘dark oi the moon.'—
cenae pater: he is called also erus
(vss. 16, 43), ipse (23), parochus
(36), and conw'oator (73), as well
as Nasidienus (1, 75, 84) and
Rufus (58).

if. acria: introducing the
whole list and repeated in qualia
. . . stomachum. The relishes
are only partly in use now nor is
the precise identification of them
at all important: ‘rape, lettuce,
radishes, skirret. fish-pickle, and
burnt tartar from Coan wine.'
These were arranged around (cir-
cum) the boar, perhaps on the
same platter.
