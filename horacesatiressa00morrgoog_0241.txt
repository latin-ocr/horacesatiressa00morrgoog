to remind ourselves that slavery was an ever-present reality in the Roman

world, in order to understand how the doctrine could have been called

a paradox at all. This satire is, therefore, even inore than the third,

and more, indeed, than any other in the Second Book, a direct attack

upon the follies of mankind. But the sharpness which shows itself in

some of the satires of the First Book is entirely avoided by the humorous

expedient of representing the satire as directed against Horace himself,

³⁸ as in the close of the third. That Horace is not drawing a picture of

τ’ himself, however, is plain from such passages as vs. 5 3, vss. 89 ff, 102

. ff, 110 f.; the faults there attacked are not those to which Horace was

prone. But there is enough caricature of himself (vss. 23 ff, 29 ff.) to

· add a pleasant humor to the whole. lt must be said also that there is
some return to the intentional coarseness of Sat. 1, 2.

finding that his master is alone, sis vitalzs metuo, he is good, but

he ventures to speak. The hesi-
tation and humility (servus) os the
first words are meant to contrast
with his boldness later.

2. Davusne: Horace is preoc-
cupied and only half recognizes
the slave's voice. The name is a
traditional name for a slave.

3'. frugi: the ordinary adjec-
tive in comedy for a good slave,
as nequam is the adjective sor the
opposite-quod sit satis: a hu-
morous modification of the claim

not so good as to be in danger of
dying young—Decembri: at the
feast os the Saturnalia slaves were
given a considerable liberty of ’
speech and action, in memory of
the Golden Age when there were
no masters and no slaves.

5. narra: specil, this is the
