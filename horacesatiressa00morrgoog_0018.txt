discriminating hpiryopist, and the formal Stoic, apparently more
η concerned about the growth oi his beard than about his growth i

than upon their intelligibility, appealed to both sides oi his ¹
mind. In the long picture gallery of the Satires no ligure is
more frequently recurrent. Nor did Horace neglect the men of
