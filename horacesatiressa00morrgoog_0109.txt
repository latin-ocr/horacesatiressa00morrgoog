-This incidental picture 01 the
Roman Forum, though it is inten-

’ tionally exaggerated is in har-

mony with what Juvenal says in
his third satire 01 the dangerously
crowded Roman streets. The
Forum was the official center 01
< all political and public life, the
place where the funeral proces·
sions 01 great men, with their
horns and trumpctS, paused to
listen to the laudatio, and it was
at the same time the principal busi-
ness center 01 the city. Atthis
period great public works also were
under construction, which neces·
sitated the hauling ’01 blocks 01
stone in heavy wagons. .

45. Nunc ad me redeo: ie. to
vs. 6, as the repetition here 01
the last words 01 that line shows.
The intervening verses are not
altogether adigression 3 they meet
the suspicion that Horace was am·
bitious 01 political influence, and
thus enable him to pass lightly
over that criticism (vss. 48-50)
and to come to the main theme

⁵ 01 the satire, the dignity and com-

fort 01 a quiet lif .

47 f. sim, pareret: subju, giv-
ing the reasons 01 the critics as
expressed by themselves. — con-
victor: 01. Sat. 1, 4, 95, convictore

tum. This curious episode in his
life is briefly mentioned in the
Vita Horati 01 Suetonius: bello
Philippensi excitus a M. Bruto
imperatore tribunus militum me·
ruit.

49. honorem: effice, as in the
phrase cursus honorum, and often.

5⁰· iure: it is, however, un-
likely that the office was given to
him without reason. Probably he
had shown, even in his student
years at AthenS, those qualities 01
sanity and good judgment which
made him in later life the valued
friend 01 men 01 affairs. — te: obj.
01 invideat.

51 1. cautum dignos assumere:
the friends whom Maecenas had
already gathered about him were
menos high standing and charac-
ter, and, especially, men interested
in literature rather than in politics.
Admission to this circle was, 01
itself, evidence tb'at Horace was ’
not cherishing a political ambi-
tion. -prava ambitione procul:
