2, 3, 226] HORATI

Hic simul accepit patrimoni mille talenta,
edicit, piscator uti, pomarius auceps,
unguentarius, ac Tusci turba impia vici,
κ cum scurris fartor, cum Velabro om-ne macellum,
230 mane domurn veniant. Quid tum? Venere frequentes. ⁴
Verba facit leno: ‘Quicquid mihi, quicquid et horum
cuique domi est, id crede tuum, et vel nunc pete vel
cras'
Accipe quid contra iuvenis responderit aequus:
‘ In nive Lucana dormis ocreatus, ut aprum
²35 cenem ego; tu piscis hiberno ex aequore verris;
segnis ego, indignus qui tantum possideam: aufer!

ProgresS, not inferior in its irony scurris: ascurra wasa hanger-on
and its real moral power to Ho- os some richer mama professional ,ζ
garth's engravings. The effec· diner·out who lived by his wits.- t
tiveness of it lies in the artifice of

representing the essentials os a
spendthrist's career as if the events
had actually occurred in this bare
form. For Horace does not mean
that such a gathering as this took
place or that these words were
uttered, but that this is what the
whole story really amounts to, if
we go below the sursace. There
is a grave irony in the lines and
the burlesque of the Stoic manner
is dropped.

227 ii. edicit: proclaims by his
attitude and conduct. 'Cf. Sat. 2,

· 2, 51 for a similar, ironical use

of this formal word—piscator,
pomarius, . . . : purveyors os va-
rious luxuries—Tusci . . . vici: a
street leading from the Forum
toward the river, one of the dis-

fartor: perhaps tlte musagomaker.
— Velabro: a street opening from
the Tuscus vicus, a center of the
trade in various kinds of pro·
videns—Quid tum: what next?

232. leno: the procurer is the
suitable spokesman.

233. aequus: fair-minded5 for κ
their valuable services he proposes ³
to makeafairreturn. ,

²34· Lucana: the boars of Lu·
cania were especially esteemed for
mod-ocreatus: greaves were
worn to protect the hunter from
the tuslrs of the boar. These de· ἵ
tails of hardship and danger carry κ
on the irony of aequus.

233. hiberno: cs. Sat. 2, 2, rof.

237. deciens: sc. centena milia
sestertium, a millr'rrn, of course an
absurd sum.
