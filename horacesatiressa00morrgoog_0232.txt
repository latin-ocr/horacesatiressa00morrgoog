figures are slightly different from
ours‚ but we say ‘it runs through

Ι my head,' ‘it springs into my

mind’-Ante secundam: before

36 f. These lines afford an in·
teresting little glimpse into the
professional relations oi Horace
as a member still of the ordo of

signature on the document. This

would be like putting ‘OK' and ⁴¹
initials onapaper. As it is known ζ
that, during the months within j

which thecomposition of this satire
must fall, Maecenas was the repre·

sentative ol Octavius in Rome and ’

had authority to use his seal, the

document was probably one that ¹

had to do with public business.
39. Dixeris: as if putting the

reader into Horace's position, to

make the situation more vivid.

is apparently intended to suggest ¹,
increasingly- definite reminiscence : ³

‘it's seven years—almost eight

minor goverument officials, the —since . . .'-iam fugerit: wt'll
scribae. It is, iu effect, a notice soon have passed-F or the story

of a meeting of the organization
(⁴important business'), given
orally to Horace, who is ad-
dressed familiarly by his ‘first'
name-orabant meminisses: par-
amus—reverti: zie. ‘to come
back to the meeting-place to which
he used to come when he was an
active member of the organization.’

38. Imprimat. . ‚curaz para·
taxis, like cura valeas, sac sis fidelis.
—signau ie. he wished Horace to
ask Maecenas to set his seal and

of the introduction‚ see Sat. 1, 6,
54ff. The expression here is al·
most the same as the one used
there, iubes esse in amicorum nu· ,-
mera with the evident intention
of recalling that satire, as the next
words recall the journey to Brundi-
sium, Sat. 1, 5. The earlier claims
to friendship ¹are here qualified, to ¹
guard against the interpretations

which had been put upon them. ,

The friendship¹ has nothing to do
with public affairs.
