he resumed his comxmentary on life and society in the form
, of efflkssin hexameter. By'the choice of anew and different
form he freed himself from the limitations oi satire3 at the
same time, as the tradition ol the epistle in verse was less

ot his works were in wide circulation, often prefaced by the
account of his lile from Suetonius and annotated with scholia.
During the Middle Ages, when knowledge of the ancient world
was at its lowest, his poems were still read in schools and fre-

of Learning many editions were issued from the early printing
presses. In modern times they have formed a part ot the
