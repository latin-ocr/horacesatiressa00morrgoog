INTRODUCl'lON

mental optimism, 3 very superficial and uninteresting quality.
Horace was a man of warm feeling and 01 strong convictionS,
though his convictions 0101011311 alien to our thought, and the
lightness with which he sometimes touches serious things is EQ
the lightness 01 031010550055. Ηο had learned early, not with-
out strug'ge‘i'ind pain, the lesson 01 adjustment to the limita-
tions 01 1110, hacl learned that the secret of'a' 'c‘oiuposed and
dignified 1110 1105 10 1110 3000013000 01 the inevitable. Even in
his less cheeriul moods he faced his heaviest losses with steadi·

But his ordinary mood was not tragic3 he preferred to meet
1110 with a smile, not underestimating the possibilities 01 1055
¹ and trouble, but· also not overestimating them. And it is the
fact that his genial acceptance 01 1110 10515 upon a foundation 01
0001 judgmeut and shrewd comprehension that gives it meau-
ing. Itis this combination that makes him the philosopher 101
men oi the world. For the man 01 affairs, 11 he is conscious 01
1110 at all, is seeking 101 a formula which will include all the
follies and weaknesses 01 1000 and will teach him how to accept
them with 3 smile. Thelreal meaning 01 Horace’s philosophy
is poorly expressed by m'l admirari, as the words are commonly
understood, and not very well by aurea mediocrius,- it is a phi· -
losophy of comprehensionem} tolerance, aud the charm 01 1115
personality is that he so perfectly embodies his own doctrine.
The value of his comments upon men and society lies partly
in the application 011115 philosophy to 1110, partly in the peculiar
forms in which he expresses it. His satires, and, to a less
degree, his epistles, are a picture gallery. He does not describe
individuals or, 11 he (1005, ii is in teims so general as to make
them types; his little pictures 310 done in few lines, but in lines .
so expressive that they tell the essential truth about a man.
Such a characterization as that 01 Tigellius in Sat. 1, 3 or that
