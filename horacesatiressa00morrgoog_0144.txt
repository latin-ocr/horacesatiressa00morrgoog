Hoc erat, experto frustra Varrone Atacino

atque quibusdam aliis, melius quod scribere possem,
inventore minor; neque ego illi detrahere ausim
haerentem capiti cum multa laude coronam.

At dixi fluere hunc lutulentum, saepe ferentem
plura quidem tollenda relinquendis. Age, quaem,
tu nihil in magno doctus reprehendis Homero?
nil comis tragici mutat Lucilius Acci?

46. Hoc: satire-Varrone: M.
Terentius Varro, called Atacinus
from the river Ater, in southern
Gaul, where he was born, to dis·
tinguish him from the great anti-
quarian and scholar of the same
name. He wrote in several styleS‚
bnt without marked success in
any.

47. quibusdam aliis: it is not
to he supposed that Horace stood
alone in writing satire in the
Augustan peri0d; the names of
some of the alii are known, hut
all knowledge ol their writings is
lost.

48 i. inventore minor: conces·
sive3 ‘even though l fall short of
Lucilius! lt was an accepted
doctrine ol literary history that
Lucilius was the inventor ol satire,
that is, was the first to put it into
hexameter and give it the distinct
form which it therealter retained.
— The thought of these verses, 48-
49, is connected with the preced-
ing, hocerat. . . possem, as if it
wasa natural consequence‘of his
choice of satire. Is it had been
put into a separate sentence, it

would have been strongly adver-
sative3 ‘but l do not claim to be

his equal nor desire to lessen his ’

credit' ,,

50 f. At dixi: repeating with em-
phasis dixi of vs. r.-fluere: the
figure used in 1, 4, 11, as tollenda
repeats erat quod tollere velles —

relinquendis: abl. after the com- l

par. plura. The rubbish seemed

often more in amount tthan the =

water which swept it along. But ·‘

the figure is not very clearly con·
ceived.

52. noctus: with all your learn-
ing5 the word frequently implies
a slur.

Homer freely.

53. comis: genzhlkindly. The l

word is used as if it were quoted

from the admirers of Lucilius as ¹

below, vs. 65, and is selected
for the partial contrast with
tragici.†mutat: not actually,
but by implication. — Acci:
L. Accius the greatest of the
early writers of tragedy. Only

fragments of his works are ex· ι

tant.
