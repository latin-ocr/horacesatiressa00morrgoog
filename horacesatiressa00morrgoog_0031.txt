two verbs, dederit, obtererit, carry ordinary usage, wezglzed daton with
on the eontrast between the de· years, not distinguishing between

liberate and the accidental.

3. laudet: the full expression
’ of the thought would seem to re-
quire sed unus quisque laudet, but
the negative of nemo goes only
with contentus, not with vrbat, so

⁸ s of service,
eated and

years of life an

and the thought
amplified in the next phrase.—
fractus membra: broken in health.

The soldier, feeling old and worn,
says, ‘l wish l had gone into

discontented with his own life and
