The sense of the whole is, ‘I am
content with what Ι have. Ihave
not tried (and shall not try) to
increase it as men usually do and
l (have not been tempted and)
shall not be tempted into the
common fault of wastefulness.'

8. veneror: arather infrequent
use, with cognate acc. or acc. of
the thing asired for, without the
acc. of the person. Cf. Corm.
Soec. 49. ‘If l utter no such
prayer as these.'-0 si: this ex-
pression of a wish is explained in
the grammars and is familiar to us
from the correspondmg English3
‘oh, if only . . .’

9. accedat: were added to his
farm-denormat: a technical
term in surveying; expressive of
the natural and common desire to
have a farm marked by straight
border-lines.

10. urnam argenti: almost ex-
actly the English o pot of money,
in its original sense.

naturally be in the main clause,
but is put into the relative clause in

treasure and with it bought and

cultivated the very farm on which ⁴
he had been beforeahired laborer) ’

13. Hercule: there are a few
references, not perfectly clear, to
Hercules as the god of hidden
treasures, but the explanation of
the reference to him here is to be
found in thefolk-story that Horace
is alluding to, which is given by

Porphyrio: ‘traditur fabula, fuisse ,
quendam mercennarium qui sem· ἒ

per Herculem deprecatus sit, ut
sibi boni aliquid praestaret. Quem
Hercules ad Mercurium duxit et
obsecratum thesaurum fecit
ostendi. Quo effosso ille eundem
agrum, in quo operam mercen-
narium faciebat, comparavit et
labori solito operam dedit; sique
probavit Mercurius, quod de eo
praedixerat Herculi, nulla re illum
posse beatum vivere, cum in eadem
opera post inventionem thesauri
perseveravit) In his allusion Hor-
