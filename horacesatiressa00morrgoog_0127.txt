“a
» This satire was written between 38 and 35 ne, later than the first
group, Satires 2, 7, and 8, but before Satire 1 and probably before 10.
There is no allusion which makes a more precise dating possible and,
as is usually the case where distinct allusions are lacking, there is
nothing in the satire which would gain in interpretation if a more pre-
cise date could be fixed.
In form the satire is an account of a morning walk in which Horace
, was joined bya mere acquaintance, who desired to cultivate a closer
intimacy with him, in order, as finally appeared, to secure through him
an introduction to Maecenas. Various attempts to shake him off were
unsuccessful and an appeal to a passing friend was without effect, until
chance intervened to save the poet. ln grace and lightness of tone the
' satire is equaled only by some of the odes. The struggle between
politeness and the desire to be free, the humorous consciousness of the
joke upon himself, the happily conceived dramatic form, reaching a
climax in the encounter with F uscus—all these make it uunecessary
to look for an underlying purpose. But a secondary motive was
doubtless the opportunity which the story afforded of returning to the
theme of the sixth satire and of showing again how ill-founded was
the suspicion that Horace was secking social advancement through his
’ acquaintance with Maecenas.

Ibam forte Via Sacra, sicut meus est mos
nescio quid meditans nugarum, totus in illis:
accurrit quidam notus mihi nomine tantum,

1. Via Sacra: the principal poems,e.g. Catull.r,4.—totus:s0

street of the city, running from
the Esquiline past the Palatino,
along one side of the Forum. It
was the street which Horace would
naturally take in going from the
residence part of the city to the
⁵ Tiber.—sicut . . . mos: cf. 1, 6,
112, 1223 with ibam, not with
meditans.

, 2. nugarum: verses,- almosta
¹ technical term for light lyric

121

orrrnr's in hoc sune, Epist. 1, 1, 11.

3. notus. . . tantum: tle. a
mere acquaintance. The person
cannot be identified, nor is it at
all likely that Horace had iu mind
a definite individual or was re·
countiug the events of an actual
experience. His purpose was
rather to draw a typical picture
of the Social Struggler, without
direct reference to any individual.
