There are many allusions in this satire to persons and events, but
none sufficiently definite to fix the date of composition. Evidently it
was written after Sat. 4 and therefore after 2, 7, and 8, somewhere
between 38 Bc. and 35. The large circle of friends whose names are
mentioned in the closing lines would indicate a late date, and the
¹general tone is that of an epilogue to the whole collection, as the first
satire is an introduction to the whole. This interpretation also har·
monizes with the last line of the satire (see notes).

‘lt is quite true thatl said that Lucilius was a rough verse writer. f

His power as a satirist 1 acknowledge, but that alone does not make a
poet. Many other qualities are necessary to a poetic style, brevity,
variety, wit, such polished wit as is found in the Old Comedy, of which,
indeed, some of my critics seem never to have heard. The mingling
of Greek with Latin in Lucilius is not a merit, buta defect3 no serious
Roman writer mixes the two languages or writes in Greek at all. ,

‘The grand style I leave to others to attempt, successfully or not.
My aim is less ambitious. The frelds of comedy and tragedy‚ of epic

and bucolic poetry, are well occupied and l have turned to satire, not, ⁴

however, to be the rival of Lucilius or to lessen his glory. But it is
true that l have mentioned his defects, as he had noticed the defects
of Ennius and Accius. The copiousness of Lucilius and his lack of
finish are real defects, which, if he were writing noW, he would himself
perceive and correct.

‘For finish of style appeals to the only public worth considering. . .

Hermogenes may not like my work, but if Plotius and Varius, Maecenas
and Vergil, approve, I need no other defence and can publish this book
of satires without misgivings.'
