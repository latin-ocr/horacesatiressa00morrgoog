1, 3, 137] HORATI

Ne longum faciam, dum tu quadrante lavatum
rex ibis, neque te quisquam stipator ineptum
p'raeter Crispinum sectabitur, et mihi dulces
140 ignoscent, si quid peccaro stultus, amici,
inque vicem 'illorum patiar delicta libenter,
privatusque magis vivam te rege beatus.

137. Ne longum faciam: cf. ne 120 f.-et: correlated with -que,
te morer, Sat. 1, r, 14, and the 141.
more abrupt iam satz's, 1,1, 120. 140. stultus: in the Stoic use

-quadrantez one fourth of an as, of the word- With these verses ¹

the price of admission to the pub· Horace returns to the serious
lic baths. thought of the earlier part of the

138-139. stipator: as an satire, which is in fact latent in
escort. - ineptum: with Cris· his mind even while he is ridi·
pinum, who is called lippus culing the Stoic solemnity and
and otherwise derided in 1, r, Pharisaism.

There is no reference in this satire which fixes the date precisely, and
we are obliged to fall back upon general indications. The criticisms to
which it is a reply were called forth by the sensational and persona]
tone of the early seventh and eighth satireS, and especially of the
second, in particular, vss. 91 ff. show that this was written after the
second and, probably, very soon after it. Maecenas is not mentioned
in 'this satire, as he is not referred to in the other earlier ones, though a
personal mention would have been natural in 8,8 and 14. Nor is there

any reference to the group of distinguished friends whose approval is
in the tenth satire the final answer to the critics. This satire may

l

therefore with probability be placed with 2, 7 and 8 of this book and ἐ

with some of the Epodes, all written before Horace's introduction to
Maecenas in 38.

' The reference to Tigellius (vs. 72) is too vague to give any indica· e

tion of the date (cf. note on 1, 3, 4).

‘The great Athenian writers of comedy were the founders of satire.
After them came Lucilius, not less keen than they, but too careless and
too profuse. His faults Ι desire to avoid, for mere quantity is not a
merit3 but the spirit of his satire l shall attempt to preserve. l am
