‚ 326. This turns the teaching of Damasippus (vss. 298 f.) back
upon himself.

The date of this satire cannot be lixed, but its character is such that
the precise date is of no importance. lt was probably written after
Sat. 2, 2.

In form it is, like the preceding satire, a main body of discourse
enclosed in a framework of dialogue. Horace meets upon the street
an acquaintance who is hurrying home to commit to writing certain
precepts of gastronomy which he had just heard. At Horace's request
he consents to repeat them and after he has done so, in the main body
of the satire (vss 12-87), Horace, deeply impressed, begs that he may

’ himself be allowed to attend the next lecture on the important subject

and hear with his own ears. The introductory dialogue and the con-
cluding request are less dramatic than the corresponding parts of the
preceding satire, but they contrast in a somewhat similar way the
enthusiasm of the believer with the attitude of Horace and they are
admirable specimens of ironical deference.

The main discourse consists of a series of precepts for the selection
and serving of the courses ofa dinner. They follow in general the
order of the Roman dinner, the gustatzb, the main course, wines and

v sauces, and the dessert, with advice about the service of the table.

· Each precept is given separately, as if it were an oracle which needs no
explanation or logical connection. The style is serious and almost
epic, as befits the seriousness of the speaker, but there is no such
parody of the manner of the philosopher as in Satires 2 and 3. The
irony which is easily felt in the dialogue is here less apparent, especially
to the modern reader, to whom many of the details of Roman cookery
must remain unknown. The reader of Horace's time, however, would

¹ feel at once the absurdity of the precepts, both in general and in details,

and would therefore be conscious of the humor of lines which to the
modern reader are rather dull.

The speaker is called Catius and he is represented (vs. 11) as quoting
from the discourse of an authority on gastronomy whose name he avoids
giving. This is, in form, the same device that is used in Sat. 2, 3, where
Damasippus quotes from Stertinius, and in Sat. 2, 7, in which the slave
