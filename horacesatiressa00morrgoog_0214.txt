The date of this satire is fixed by vss. 62 ff. The phrase tellure
marique magnus would not have been used in the years y'ust before r
Actium, when it was increasingly apparent that the supremacy by sea i
was still to be decided. After Actium there was a general expectation i
that Octavius would carry out the project of his uncle for a war of con·
quest in the East and it is to such expectations that Parthis horrendus
refers. The satire was written soon after the battle of Actium, late in
3¹ or early in 30.

The subject-matter is the practice of secking legacies. To treat this ¹
as a profession, however, is to take satire too seriously3 it was a social
evil, like free divorce or political bribery, which the satirist ridicules by i
assuming an ironical seriousness. The custom of leaving legacies, often t
small, but not infrequently of substantial amount, to many friends was i
already common in the Ciceronian period. lt was to be expected that p
the custom would lead to the cultivation of friendships in the hope of a
legacy and the tendency was strengthened by the large increase of
wealth in the hands of men who did not know how to use it. Such
men, often of the freedman clasS, sometimes without family connections, ¹
would be especially open to the flattering approaches of persons of y
higher position.

The satire is a continuatim, in burlesque, of a scene in the Odyssey, i
11, 90ff. The shade of the Theban seer, TiresiaS, meets Odysseus in l
the lower world and at his request tells him how he may secure his ,
return to lthaca and how he may summon the shade of his mother.
After this interview the seer returns (vss. 150 f.) to the home of Hades.

At this point Horace interjects the conversation which forms this satire.
The selection of the venerable prophet of Thebes to give advice such J
as this is as happy as the selection of Trebatius in Sat. 2, 1, and Odys· i
