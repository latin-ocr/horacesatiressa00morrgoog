Nothing in this satire fixes the date of composition. lt can only
be said that it was written between 35 and 30 13.c.,and that in subject
, and general treatment it is like the other satires of this book.

- In form it most closely resembles Sal. 2, 43 the main part of it is

an account of certain sayings and doings related by another person to
Ι Horace at his request, with a brief introductory dialogue. The sub-
ject-matter connects it both with Sat. 2, 2, as a contrast to simple
living, and with 2, 4, as a satire in a different vein upon the serious-
minded epicure.

The main body of it is a description of a dinner, given in much
³ detail. The names of the guests are mentioned and their places at the
table and there are elaborate descriptions of the food and cookery. ·
After the dinner had advanced a little and the host had shown a dis-

· position to brag of his food and wines‚ some of the guests proposed

heavy drinking. The host turned their attention again to the food, but
while he was describing one of the disheS, a canopy over the table tell
and covered the whole company with dust. The host at this mishap
burst into tears and was with difficulty induced by the encouragements
of some of his guests, which he did not perceive to be ironical, to pro·

a ceed with the feast. When he did go on, he continued to talk so much

about the food, that the guests, in revenge, declined to eat it. The
satire ends abruptly, without the concluding dialogue or comment which
is generally found in the satires of this book.

This is not a description of some actual dinner at the house of an
individual who might be identified. All attempts to connect the host,
Nasidienus Ruqu, with some person known to us, -for example, with
, Salvidienus Rufus,—fail in details and are mistaken in their purpose.
’ It is quite inconceivable that Horace should have made public the
story of such a dinner, at which Maecenas and Varius were guests,
and should have represented a well-known man like Fundanius as
' guilty of the extreme discourtesy of ridiculin'g the host whose invita-
tion he had accepted. To readers of Horace's time the mere fact that
the story is told by Fundanius, the writer of humorous playS, would at
Α once have given the clew to the burlesque character of the whole. lt
⁴ is no more to be taken as serious narrative than the legal consultation
, in Sat. 2, 1, the discourse of Ofellus in 2, 2, the sermon of Damasippus
in 2, 3, or in fact any satire of this book except the earlier half Of the
sixth.
