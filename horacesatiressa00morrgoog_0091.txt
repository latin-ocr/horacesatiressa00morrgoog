lations were never clearly defined and were iu constant need of read-
justment. ,ln the year 40 nc. an arrangement called the Treaty of
Brundisium was made by Maecenas representing Caesar, Asinius

’ Pollio, representing Antonius, and Cocceius, as the friend of both

sides. This explains sola'tz' componere (29). ln the following yearS,
3g38 nc, Caesar was tfflce defeated by the fleet of Sextus Pompeius
and was obliged to call upon Antonius for aid. Antonius came to
Brundisium in the spring of 39, but Caesar did not meet him at that
time, or, so faras is known, send representatives to a conference. But

Ι in the autumn of 38, the difficulties with Sextus Pompeius increasing‚

Maecenas was sent to Athens to confer with Antonius. With him went
' Fonteius Capite, as a friend of Antonius, and Cocceius, presumably to
be a referee, as on the previous occasion, and the three ambassadors
were accompanied on the overland joumey to the port of Brundisium
by a party of literary friendS, Horace, Vergil, Plotius Tucca and Varius
(the two friends to whom the publication of the Aener'd was intrusted
after the death of Vergil), and a Greek rhetorician, Heliodorus. The
satire was probably written soon after the date of the joumey, late in

, 38 or early in 37.

The connection of thought is simple3 the satire is a rather bare
η recital of the events of the journey, with some description of humorous
episodes and adventures. The route can be easily followed on a map
and the daily stages are for the most part indicated. But Horace was
not writing a guidebook of the well-known route, and he has intention-
ally paraphrased the names of some places (24, 37, 45, 79 f.‚ 87) and
has used phrases which leave it uncertain whether the party spent a
night at Anxur, at Capua, or at Beneventum( The joumey was made

> partly on foot (though this is not certain), partly in a canal boat, but

chiefly by riding or driving. The distance was about 340 English
mileS, the time from twelve to fifteen days.

The satire has a certain accidental interest from the glimpses it gives
of the manner of traveling in the year 38 13.c., and it contains afew
interesting personal allusions (27-29‚ 32-33, and especially 39-44), but
it is for the most part made up of trivialities. lt falls short to a sur-
, prising degree of the account which we should expect Horace to give of
a fortnight's association with a group of menso cultivated and so emi·
nent. There are two explanations of the limitations of the satire. ln
the first place, personal biography and reminiscence are modern ¹3 they
had not made a place in ancient literature. The nearest approach to

' them would be in books like Caesar's Commentaries or Cicero’s account

of his consulship-both in reality political pamphlets-or in the
