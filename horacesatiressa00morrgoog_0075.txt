aware, however, that exposure of the weaknesses of men makes my
writings unpopular, and l desire to say a word in sels-defence.
‘ln the first place, l do not think that satire is poetry or should be

, judged by the standards of poetry. lt lacks the imaginative inspiration

and the lofty expression os poetry‚ and is, in this respect, like comedy,
amere reproduction in verse-form of ordinary talk on everyday subjects.

‘The main question, however, is whether the satirist deserves to be
·regarded with dislike and suspicion. Yon compare him to a detective,
not noticing that you thereby compare yourself to a criminal, but the
comparison <fails because ‘my notes are not taken for use in a court or
for publication. Yon say that the satirist is a man oi meanly critical
spirit, who finds pleasnre in exhibiting the failings of others. But this
also is untrue3 my satire is no more personal or serious than the rail-
lery of a good talker at a dinner table. It is in fact only the exercise
of a habit of observation taught me by my good father, who without
knowing the philosophy oi books instructed me in a practical philoso-
phy founded on observation. The only fault you can find with me is

ἵ that I write down my observations. But everybody nowadays writes;

if you object to that, we'll unite to condemn you and the penalty shall

’ be that you shall turn writer yourself.'

Α The connection of thought is less clearly indicated in this satire than
in the first or third3 there is occasional sharpness of retort and there
is little oi the mellow humor of the later work. These are the marks
of immaturity. The sensitiveness to criticism, also, is of the kind that
decreases with experience.
