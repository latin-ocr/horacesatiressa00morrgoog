SERMONES

[2‚ 6, 6

³ young republican who fought at Philippi, orby the satirical follower
of the more satirical Lucilius, but by a contented friend and citizen.

Hoc eratin vot is: modus Qu ffigpus

hort tus ubi et tecto vicinus iugis aquae fons

et paulum silvae super h1s ‘i‘re Auctius atque

di melius fecere. Bene est. Nil amplius or0‚ Α

Si neque maiorem feci ratione mala rem,

1. Hoc: elaborated in the rest ..

of the sentence, but with reference
also to the scene that lay before

ι him, as he looked out from his

farm-house in the morning-in
votis: ‘was one of the things for
which Ι made my vowsst

2. iugis: in form either gen.
or nom, but the balance — vicinus
—sons‚ ragal-aquae—requires a
genitive.

3. super his: the acc. is more
common, but the abl. is freely used

‘⁸ by‘ Horace (super fara, Carm. 1,

9, ς, saper Pindo, Carm. 1, 12,
6). His usage favors the local
meaning above these (not in addi-
tion ta these things), ia. on the
overhanging ridge‘of the hill. This
little wood-land is referred to also

ι in Carm. 3, 16, 29 f.‚ silva iugerum

paucorum and in Epz'st.1‚ 14, 1,
and there rs a fullerdescription' m

lt'berally.
5. Maia nate: cf. Vergil's
nate dea. Mercury, as the god of

« gain (ag. Sat. 2, 3, 25), was the
'‘ god to whom the prayer for am-

plius would be addressed.—haec

. munera : even more distinctly
than hac, vs. 1, a reference to the
scene before him—faxis: the
archaic form ( sac-sah, a sigmatic
aorist optative), still used in pray-
ers and curses

of. Cf. the advice¹ of the
father to his two sons, Sat. 2, 3,
177 f., and the note there. The
thought here is the same, hut it is
expressed somewhat elliptically
and with a careful contrast of
phrasin'g which covers up the
thought. The real emphasis is
upon Horace's contentment with
what he has and his determination
to avoid in the future, as he has
in the past, either of the extremes
against which so much of his
preaching is directed, either the
extreme of money-loving or the
opposite extreme of wastefulness.
There is no contrast between
ratione mala and some ratio bana
nor between vitia culpave and
some creditable way of lessening
one's property, ag. by charity3
the contrast is between theavarvs
with his usual ratio mala and the
nepas with his vz'ta'zva culpave.
