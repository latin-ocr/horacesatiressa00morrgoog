47. inter: prepositions of two
syllables are osten placed aster the
noun in Horace.

48. accipias: pres.; when the
train ol slaves halts for the noon-
day lunch. -portavitz perf.; ou
the march, now past.

49. intra naturae finis: this
limitation‚ a doctrine of Stoic phi-
losophy, is necessary to the ar-
gument, which is directed, not
against great fortunes iu them-
selveS‚ but against the accumula·
tion of unused wealth.

5⁰· viventi: with refert the

53. cumeris granaria: canterat
are described by the scholiast as
small bins'os wickerwork or large
earthenware jars, used for storing y
small quantities of grain. The
word is somewhat rare, but is
used again by Horace (Epist. 1, 7,
30) and was perhaps familiar to
him from the management of his
own small farm. lt is, of course,
set in contrast to the granaria of
the large estate, and the sentence
really repeats the idea ol 45-46
and of 49-51.
