HORATI

‘Trebatius people say that my satire is worthless. What shall l do i
about iti-Keep still l—What, not write at all?-Yes.-By Jove, 1

you may be right. But l ean't go to sleep. ’- Can’t sleep? Take some
exercise and drink a bottle of wine just before bed-time and you will
sleep perfectlywell. Or, if what you mean is that you can't stop writing,
then write about Caesar3 that is work that will pay you—l wish Ι
could, my dear sir. but lam not equal to describing battles.-Then ‘
write about his justice and his energy.—Some other time, per-
haps3 just now l don't think l will try it. -lt would be a great deal
better than the things you do write, which make enemies on all sides. i
-1 can't help myself. Writing is my hobby. l have fighting blood
in my veins, as Lucilius had iu his. But l never attack3 l simply de

help myself; write l must- Yon won't live long if you stick to that ,
course. Some of your great friends will tum a cold shoulder to you,- i

· what, did Lucilius's friends desert him? l am not as great a man

as he waS, but ifany man attacks me, he will find that l am no easy i
prey— unless of course, you advise differently. -No, l don't think l
can say anything against that. But there are libel laws for the writers i
of bad verses. - Bad verses! YeS, but mine are not bad, they are very
good. Can l be sued for writing'good versesl- Certainly not. Gooe
poetry is above all law.'

ln issuing a second collection of writings in the same style as that by ‚
which he had already won both friends and enemieS, Horace thought it ²
well to preface it with a further defence of satire, continuing the subject i
of r, 4 and 1, 10. But as 1, 10 is at once less serious and more assured
than r, 4, so this satire is less obviously argumentative than r, ιο. lts
underlying purpose is self-defence and explanation, but under the cover
of pure burlesque. lt represents aconsultation between Horace and his
legal adviser, C. Trebatius Testa. The latter is well known to us
through the group of letters addressed to him by Cicero (ad Fam. 7, 6- '
22) 3 hewas a distinguished jurisconsult anda man of much humor, and
therefore a suitable figure fora burlesque consultation. The dialogue
is managed with great skill; Trebatius, in adry, legal manner, gives
prudent advice, which Horace rejects as fast as it is given, argning with
much heat in favor of the course that he had already determined upon
before he went through the form of consulting the lawyer. The argu-
ments, t00, by which Horace defends his course are all farciml: Mi· ,
lonius gets drunk and dances, therefore l may write satire3 the bull ¹
goreS, the wolf bites, and Scaeva poisons his mother, therefore l may
use my satire to wound and poison. From beginning to end there is
