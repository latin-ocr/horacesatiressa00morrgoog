Crispinus (vs· 45)· Such machinery ol the satirical form is not to be

taken seriously3 in Sat. 2, 7 itis plainly a mere johe and the Damasip ι

pus-Stertinius relation in Sat. 2, 3 serves only to give a backgronnd lor ¹
the parody of Stoic preaching. Of the various identifications of Catius ·

the only one which has both plausibility and point is the one proposed

by Mauso and revived by Palmer, that the name is a disguise of Matius, '

the friend of Cicero, Caesar, Trebatius and Augustus. But, in fact, the
precise identification of either Catius or the mysterious auctor is of no

more importance than the precise determination of the date ofcomposi- ,ι

tion. The satire contains in itsell its own best commentary. lt is a

bit of humorous and not unfriendly irony, directed primarily against

some person whose name is ostentatiously withheld and, more broadly‚

against the science and art of gastronomy. So far as there is any per· ¹¹

⁸ sonality in it, it is of a kind which would be especially understood and

appreciated by Horace's intimate friends, and the satire belongs, in this i

respect, to the same class as Sat. 1, 9 and Sat. 2, 8. ln all three there

is the note of intimacy and it is not at all impossible that the learning .
of this satire is a parody of gastronomic conversations which Horace Ἴ

,had heard at the table oi Maecenas.
