is a Low Latin word (French
baracha), and the phrase is an in-

whole passage, 15-22, reads like
a description of a mimus, in which

vss. 4 f, which are serious in ex-
pressiori and thought, to the final
hurlesque there is a gradnal and
skillful nncovering of the under·
lying absurdity of ascribing the
discontent of men to their occu·
pations or their lot in lif .
