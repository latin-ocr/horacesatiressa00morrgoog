yet the pleasure is half spoiled by the requests of my acquaintances
that l should use my influence with Maecenas on their behalf They
do not understand that my friendship with him has nothing to do with
public affairs3 in fact, we never speak of such things, and Ι am glad to
escape from it all and get back into the country, and to hear the simple
talk of my good neighbors, like Cervius' story of the Town Mouse and
the Country Mouse)

This satire is a partial return to the forms used in the First Book. ¹

The main body of the discourse (vss. 77-117) is, it is true, formally
separated from the rest and put into the mouth of another speaker3 in
so far Horace uses the newer form with which he had been experiment- A
ing in Sat. 2, 23 2, 3. The main body, however, is not enclosed in ‚a
framework of formal dialogue, but is introduced by an expression of
personal opinion and feeling, like that with which Sat. r, 6 concludes.

It was, undoubtedly, the strength of personal feeling to be expressed ἢ
that led Horace to return to his earlier method of treatment instead of ’

using the form of Sat. 2, 2 and 2, 3, which is better suited to burlesque
and persfflage than to serious discussion.

ln general tone, also, this satire- which has in it little of the satirical
element—is a return to the manner of the First Book. lt is not, how-
ever, amere turning back. The intervening years had left their health-
ful mark upon Horace, and in his personal attitude he shows the good
effect that success in honest endeavor has upon all men of large nature3
he is not less modest, perhaps he is more modest (vss. 40-58), but he

no longer needs to explain himself or to defend his conduct. The sense “

of easy security centered about his closest friend, Maecenas, and about
the farm which was the gift of that friend, and he felt the impulse to

express his contentment. lt is to be remembered, also, that Horace

was, as Kiessling reminds 115, a ‘country b0y.' lt was in Rome that ,

he had done his work, and there he had made himself a place, but his
profoundest interest was not 111 the life of clubs and dinners. He never

ceased to feel the desire for the quieter life of the country, as this satire ,

and Epod. 2 sufficiently testify.
Meanwhile, a change had come over public affairs, not unlike the
change in his own circumstances. The rule of Octavius had justified

itself, so far as such rule can ever be justified, and the security which =

Horace had received from Maecenas, Rome had had as a gift from Mae
cenas' chief. Between Octavius and Antony no sane man could hesi-

tate, and beneath the personal contentment which this satire expresses Ἴ

it is easy to hear the note of political¹ repose and contentment which
followed the decision at Actium. This satire was not written by the
