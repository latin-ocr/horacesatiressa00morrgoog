HORATI

. ’ error, sed variis illudit partibus: hoc te
crede modo insanum, nihilo ut sapientior ille,
qui te deridet, caudam trahat. Est genus unum
stultitiae nihilum metuenda timentis, ut ignis,
ut rupis fluviosque in campo obstare queratur;
alterum et huie varum et nihilo sapientius ignis Δ
Δ per medios fluviosque ruentis: clamet amica
mater, honesta soror cum cognatis, pater, uxor,
‘Hic fossa est ingens‘hic rupes maxima, serva! '¹
non magis audierit quam Fufius ebrius olim,
cum Ilionam edormit‚ Catienis mille ducentis

51 i. hoc. . modo: referring
back to velut and also forward to
ut,· ‘just as in the woods men
stray from the path in one direc-
tion or another, — it malres no dif-
ference which side,- so you must
understand your own madness,
realizing that it is no greater than
that oi others'

53. caudam trahat: the ex·
planation os the Scholiast is
‘solent enim pueri deridentes
nescientibus a tergo caudam sus-
pendere, ut velut pecus caudam
trahant' The conservatism os
boys still preserves this form os
humor.

54. nihilum: with metuenda,
as a mere negative. Kiessling
refers to the statement of this
thought in Xenophon, illem. 1, 1,
14.-timentis: agreeing with stul·
titane, but the concrete stultns is
so plainly implied that no subject
is expressed for queratur and in
the next sentence the abstract is

forgotten and ruentis is maso, as
is agreeing with stulti.

55. in campo: i.e. on perfectly κ

cleatand level ground, where there ἵ
are no fires or cliffs or rivers.

56. huic varum: differentfrom
tlz's5 varus seems to be very rare

in this sense and perhaps has ’

some humorous effect.

57. amica: with mater (‘the
mother who loves him '), to bal·
auce honesta (ί whom he respects ³)
with soror.

59. fossa, rupes: substituted
for ignis, fluvios, merely for va-
riety.

60-62. audierit: apodosis to
the protasis expressed without st'
in claruet. -Fufius‚ Ilionam, Ca·
tienis: in the play os Pacuvius 3
there was a scene in which the
mother, Iliona, is roused from
sleep hythe spirit of her murdered
son, who addresses her with the
words stanter, te adpelle, tu, quae
curam sonmo suspensam levas,·
