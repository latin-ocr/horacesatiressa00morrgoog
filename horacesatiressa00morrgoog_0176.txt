2, 3, 1] HORATI

The synonyms for insanus collected by Teuffel (furiosus, excors, delirus,
ostiens, arrrentia versatus, donem, cerritus, coormotus, commotae mentis,

 

orantem concussus, male tutae mentz's, putridi cerebri) are evidence of the ²

‘p‘ains taken to avoid monotony.
As to the underlying motive of the satire, it seems probable that the

accusations of idleness in the opening lines were not without founda- A

tion. After the publication of the F irst Book there was probably a
period in which Horace was disinclined to go on with precisely the
same kind of writing and was perhaps turning toward lyric poetry.

During this time of ,hesitation he may well have seemed to be occupied ,

with his farm (307 f.) and to have abandoned his literary ambitions.c

To the doubts of his friends and the criticisms of his enernies this long

and carelully constructed satire was intended to be a reply. At the ι

same time it is, even more distinctly than Sat. 2, 2, an attempt to touch

the follies of mankind with a lighter touch. The burlesque of Stoic ⁹

formalism and solemnity runs through the whole and is in many places
worked out in detail, so that the satire might well be taken to bea satire

upon that sect. On the other hand, however, the absurdities and sullies v
which are the subject-matter are equally the objects of attack, but they =

are made ridiculous by exaggeration rather than reproved. If the first
partos hesermon of Stertinius (vss 82-157) becomparedw1th Sati ,1,
which deals with the same subject, the difference' m manner will be
apparent. There 1s in this satire none of the direct argument which
gives a serious tone to Sat. 1, 13 the sermon of Stertinius' ιε a series of
absurd illustratione, - St taberiuS, AristippuS, the senseless miser, OresteS,

Damasippus. Sic raro scribis, ut toto non quater anno

Opimius,- which ridicule avarice by presenting it in its extremest forms. ,
ln short, the genial raillery of Horace is bere directed by turns upon ς
the preacher, upon the congregation, and upon the satirist himself.
