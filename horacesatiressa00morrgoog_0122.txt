There is no allusion in this satire definite enough to fur the date. ‘
The plot of ground which is the scene had been a huual-place, and was
afterward acquired by Maecenas and used as the site ior his palace and
gardens. But the date when he acquired the land is not known. Nor
is it clear that the land is in the possession of Maecenas either at
the time when the events are represented as occurring or at the later
time when the garden god tells the story. The spot cannot be thought
of as still in use for burial, since the figure of Priapus stands there, and,
on the other hand, the gathering of bones (vs. 22) and the selection
of the spot by two witches as a place for incantations is scarcely com·
patible with its being a private gardeu. Apparently the events are
thought of as having occurred while the transformation from burial-
place to garden was still incomplete. Verses 14-16 allude to a later
stage, but it is strange that there should be no direct allusion to Mae-
cenas, to whom in later satires Horace refers with such evident pride
and pleasure, if he already owned the land and had built his great
house there.

The satire evidently belongs in the same period as Epodes 5 and 17,
and seems to be referred to in vss. 47, 55 and 77 oi the latter Epode.
But neither os these poems can be dated uith certainty. In the
