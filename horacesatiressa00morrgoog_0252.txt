HORATI

pervellunt stomachum, siser, allec, faecula Coa.
His ubi sublatis puer alte cinctus acernam
gausape purpureo mensam pertersit et alter
sublegit quodcumque iaceret inutile quodque
posset cenantis offendere, ut Attica virgo
cum sacris Cereris procedit fuscus Hydaspes

r 5 Caecuba vina ferens, Alcon Chium maris expers.

ro. ubi: introduces pertersit
et sublegr't5 ‘when these had been
removed and after a slave had
wiped . . .'-alte cinctus: the
same as succzhctur, 2, 6, 1073 the
slave was in the proper dress for
waiting at the table-acernam:
›napla one of the more valuable

and walked with slow step and
upright coniage—Hydaspes: an
Eastern slave-boy, named aster
the river os his native land.

15 t. Alcon: another slave.
The fact that his name is given

would seem to indicate that there ,

was some point in it, as in Hydas·

woods for dining-tables3 as one pes, but we do not know what it

might speak- of ‘the mahogany
table* not as a rarity‚ butas the
‘proper thing)

11. gausape purpureo: abl.3
this was a bitot nnnecessary dis·
play. Lucilius, iu a corresponding
passage (Marx, 568), has pur·
pareo terszr tunc lotas gausape
mensas.

η. sublegit: this is mentioned
merely asa part of the ordinary
table service in order to prepare
for the formality of the next event 3
‘a slave in proper dress wiped the
table- with a purple cloth, to be
sure — and the crumbs were gath·
cred up, when in carne . . .’

13 t. ut: with virgo,- ‘like a
girl at Athens in a religious pro·
cession' The κανηφόρος (cf.
Sat. 1, 3, 10 f.) carried the sacred
symbols in a basket on her head

was-caecuba: one of the best
of the ltalian wines, as were also
the Alban, in the time ol Horace,

and Falernian. The Chian wasa r

fine Greek wine, with which sea·
water was *sometimes sparingly
mixed to give it a tang. Horace

frequently mentions these and ’

other special kinds of wine, con-
trasting them with the ordinary
Sabine wine, as we might contrast
special French or German wines
with Californian claret, but he does

not make sharp distinctions be· ¹
tween them. The preference for ,

Caecuban came later, when the
vineyards were dying out and the
wine was becoming rare. The

many attempts of commentators .

to find hidden meanings in these

lines are all misleading. The Ἰ

slaves brought in the best ol wine,
