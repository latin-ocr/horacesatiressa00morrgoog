mum erat, vs. 7. — iustum, fortem :
τῖε. in his capacity as law-giver
(iustum) and administrator (for-

teupi· Scipiadam: fOFScfpffinem'

which could not be used in hexam-
eter3 there is no patronymic force
intheending. The younger Scipio
was a contemporary and friend of
Lucilius3 cf. vss. 65 f.-sapiens:
pred, ‘like a man of sense,’ with
an indirect reflectionuponHorace's
lackofworldlywisdom.-Lucilius:

· the mention of Horace's model in
· satire of course implies that Tre-

batius is no longer advising him
to give up satire for epis, but only
to turn his satire to more profitable
uses-Haud mihi dero: cf. 1, 9, 56,
where the context shows that cum

¹ res rpsa feret means the same thing

as dextro tenpore, ‘when a proper
opportunity shall present itselt'
18. Flacci: a Flaccus, a man

, of so humble a name as Flaccus.

in contrast with Caesaris.

19 f. attentam. . . aurem: the
comparison of Caesar to a high-
spirited horse is suggested in these
words, to be expressed more fully

in the next line—non: with the
whole phrase, not with attentam
alone or ibunt alone. - ibunt: the
future implies intention. As there
is no English phrase correspond-
ing to ire per aurem, the construc-
tion must be shifted in translation,
‘the words of a Flaccus shall not
try to reach the ear of a Caesar)-
tutus: to protect himself.

22. Quoted, with change of
case, from Sat. 1, 8, 11. The
effect is therefore as if he had said,
‘than to write such a savage verse
as that in the Eighth Satire'
Cf. 1, 4, 92, where a line of simi-
lar character is quoted from 1,
2, 27. That quotation is intro-
duced by ,ego si risi and the argu·
ment, there seriously made, is that
the line is a harmless jest.⁴ lt is
almost a necessary inference that
here also the verse quoted by Tre-
batius was regarded by Horace as
in fact quite harmless. This could
be true only if the persons referred ¹
to were either fictitious, as the
name Pantolabus certainly is, or
already notorious, as was probably
the case with Nomentanus (cf.
1, 1,102 note).
