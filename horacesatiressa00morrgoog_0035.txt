SERMONES

audaces mare qui currunt, hac mente laborem
sese ferre senes ut in otia tuta recedant,
aiunt, curn sibi sint congest a teibaria: sicut
parvola (nam exemplo est) magni formica laboris
‚ Ι ore trabit quodcumque potest atque addit acervo,
35 quem struit,*haud ignara ac non incauta futuri.

this point the thought turns more dangerous or wearisome‚ and the.
directly toward the main subject words are carefully selected:
of the satire—moneymaking- senes, ‘only when they are old¹3

and,¹ in the review of the four types
of discontented men from this
point of view, the turra const altus,
who serves for honor rather than
fees, 1s omit ted, and the caupo
hreckster, r'nnkeeper, is substi-
tuted3 as a man of the town, he
makes a good contrast to the
sarmer. For variety, the order
also is changed—perfidus: peo-
ple of the better classes seldom
used inns in traveling (compare
Sat. 1, 5), and the poor taverns
frequented by slaves and laborers
had a bad reputation for cheating
and robbery.

3⁰· currunt: this verb is used
of sailing also in Epist. 1,1,
r, 11, 27 and perhaps in Carm.
1, 28, 36. Cf. ‘run before the
wind.’-hac mente: elza is their
object, emphatic by position and
explained in the clause ut . . .
‚ recedant.

31-35· These lines contain the
explanation which men give of

otia tuta,‘ freedom from labor and
dano ger3 recolant,6 ret ire’3 con·
μείω( scraped together'3 rt‘baria,
rohons, ‘just enoug ‹rh to live on’
lt ts a reminder of the modern-
ness of the Augustan Age that
all these expressions find easy
counterparts in the talk of men
who are carrying the loads of life
in our time.

32⁴· cum. . ,sint: subjunctive
because it was a part of the indi-
rectly quoted speech.

33. parvola: colloquial diminu-
tive of parvus, to contrast with
rnogni. — exemplo: dat, ‘for
this is the pattern which they

453 choose to follow.’-nragni . . .

laboris: hard-working. This gen-
itive usually has a noun of general
meaning with it (animal, νίν), but
the omission is not infrequent·
The ant is occasionally referred to
elsewhere in Latin literature as a
model of industry (ag. Verg.
Georg. 1,186),but the frequency

their apparent inconsistency in of the comparison in modern lit-
continuing in occupations which erature is doubtless due to Prov-
they themselves complain of as erbs 6, 6.
