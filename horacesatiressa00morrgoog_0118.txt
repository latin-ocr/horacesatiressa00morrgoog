1, 7, r] HORATI

date of composition, there is left only the rather uncertain method of
adjusting its general tone to what may be supposed to have been Horace's
altitude of mind at one date or another. These indications point to the
earliest date3 the tone toward Rupilius is different from his general
altitude of loyalty toward his companions in that ill-fated campaign3
the allusion in vs. 3 to the widespread circulation of the story would be
poiutless five years after the occurrence3 the reference to Brutus in vss.
33 ff, which in any case seems flippant‚ is easier to understand if the
lines were written before the battle of Philippi and left standing as a
part of the record, than if we suppose them to have been written with
deliberation after the tragic death of Brutus. Audin general, the tone
of the satire is distinctly less mature and thoughtful than the tone of
Satires 3, 4, 6. There is a certain crudeness and harshness in it, a
certain sensationalism, a failure to reach the principles of conduct which
underlie particular events, in these respects it is like Satires 2 and8

and is to be classed with them as belonging to the earliest period of ·

Horace's work. lt is as an example of the work of that period-a
better example than either Satire 2 or 8-that it is here provided with
a commentary.

The course of the thought is so simple as to need no paraphrase.
