INTRODUCTION 1

of Damasippus in Sat. 2, 3, or the longer description by sugges· ’
tion in Sat. 1, 9, is as true and as recognizable now as it was
when it was written, because it presents the essential qualities
which are of no single period or race. The power to draw Ι
such pictures'is not, it is true, the highest kind of artistic power, 2
and it does not necessarily carry with it either a profound phi· l
losophy or great breadth oi view. Great artists have lacked it, ’
and some caricaturists have had it. The most obvious modern
illustrations are in fiction3 George Eliot had not a trace oi it,
Anthony Trollope had it inahigh degree. Such little pictures ³
do not teach us the meaning of lite, in its larger aspects and l
relations. They teach usin a nearer way about people3 they l
show us how to analyze ancl classify3 they stimulate our in· 0
telligent comprehension oi the men we meet. The reader of l
Horace, if he gets his lesson truly, understands better the man

< who sits in the seat next to him, and, if he becomes a true,
disciple, he understands himself better, t00.
