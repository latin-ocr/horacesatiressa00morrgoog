[ι’ν 9, 20

ire modo ocius, interdum consistere, in aurem

dicere nescioaquid puero, cum sudor ad imos ·
manaret talosb‘Ote, Bolane, cerebriu ² ‘ ‘²
felicem l' aiebam tacitus; cum quidlibet ille

garriret, vicos, urbem laudaret. Vt illi

nil respondebam, ‘Misere cupis’ inquit ‘abire;
iamdudum video; sed nil agis; usque tenebo; ⁴
persequar. Hinc quo nunc iter est tibi ?’ ‘Nil opus

· est te

circumagi; quendam volo visere non tibi notum ; ·
trans Tiberim longe cubat ie, prope Caesaris hortos5
‘Nil habeo quod agam, et non sum piger; usque se·

’ quar te.’

20 Demitto auriculas ut iniquae mentis asellus,

10. puero: his attendant, pedi·
sequar, to whom he pretends to
give some private orders—dicere:

Ι historical infin, as are ire and con-

sistere —sudorz as all his efforts
to escape fail.

11. Bolane: a man of hot tem-
per, who would not have been long
restrained by a sense of courtesy.
-— cerebri: for the gen, cf. amager

‚ vitae ,· for the meaning, cf. cerebro-

sus, Sat. 1, 5, 21.

13· vicos, urbem laudaret: ia.
talked cheerfully about trilles, en-
deavoring to lead Horace into
conversation.

⁴ 14¹ff· As Horace's lack of cor-

diality is too obvious lohe ignored,

³ the persistent man attempts to joke

about it, hoping in this way to
extract a disclaimer. - nil agia:
colloquial 3 it's no use.

17 f. circumagi: os your being
dragged armenii—visere: to call
upon. This is, of course, an in·
vention of the moment, elaborated
in the following words² in which
the details are given in the order
in which they occur to him ε ‘across
the Tiber — a long way off - he's
sick in bed, too—way over by
Caesar's Gardens.' Cf. the similar
embarrassed search for an excuse
in Catuli. ro, 28 ff.-Caesaris
hortos: an estate on the Jarriculum,
left by Caesar's will to the Roman
people‚ to be a public park.

20 i. Demitto auriculas: a con-
densed way of saying ‘l felt like ⁶
an ill-treated donkey, whose ears
drop down when heis overloaded.'
dorso: abl. with subiit, as in Aen.
2, 708, subito imteris. — subiit: the
subj. is asellus; onzes is the object.
