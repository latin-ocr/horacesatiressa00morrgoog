r, 5, r] HORATI

collection of Cicero's letters and of his witticisms. There are no true
parallels in Latin literature to the many books of personal reminiscence
which enrich modern literature. ln the second place, Horace was
deliberately attempting a very different task; he was writingasatire
which was intended to be a close parallel to the similar description of a , τ’
joumey in the Third Book of Lucilius, and hfiras therefore been more
closely bound by tradition in this satire than in any other. He was
deliberately following a particular model and setting himself and his ⁸
art in the closest possible comparison with the work of Lucilius. Un-
·fortunately‚ the fragments of the satire of Lucilius are too scanty— .-
about 50 verses 98-147 in Marx-to enable us to follow the eorre-
spondence into details.
