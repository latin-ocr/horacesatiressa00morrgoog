HORATI

35 excutiat sibi, non hic cuiquam parcet amic0;
et quodcumque semel chartis illeverit‚ omnis
gestiet a furno redeuntis scire lacuque
et pueros et anus' Agedum, pauca accipe contra.

34-38. Two indictments against
the satirist‚ that he finds pleasure
ininflictingpain(cilaecleregaudes,
78) and that he violates the de-
cent reserves of social intercourse
by publishing his strictures upon
individuals (repeated in 82-ss 5). -ὲ
risum excutiat: raiae a laeeglr3
excutere is used of causing tears
(Plaut. Ceph419, Ter. Hearet. 167)
and disgust (Plaut. Mere. 576).

-furnoz the poorer classes had
their baking done in public ovens
and got their water from the pub-
lic pools (lacu). At these places
crowds of slaves ( ueros) and old
women (artus) would be gathercd.
The whole involves a comparison:
the satirist is no better than a

„ scandalmonger, who retails his

gossip to the meanest of the public.

39-62. In these lines Horace
gives the earliest indication of that
interest in the theory of poetry
which appears more plainly in Set.
r, 10 and 2, 1 and in the Epistles‚
and which culminated in the Ars
Paelice. For various reasons the
passage deserves special attention.
lt contains the observations of a
conscious artist upon the art which
he was practicing with success

and such observations are always ,
interesting. At this period of his ’
life Horace was writing both Sat· .
ires and EpodeS, and this passage
reveals the effort that he was mak-
ing to distinguish between the two ,
forms and to assign to the Epodes ¹
those lyrical thoughts and emo-
tions which he found incompatible
with the conventional lirnitations
placed upon satire by Lucilius. 1
And, in themselves, the lines are
an admirable illustration of the
somewhat elusive and colloquial
form ol argument which Horace
habitually employs. The sense,
in brief, is this: ‘Satire is verse,
but not poetry, since it lacks the
imaginative thought and the lofty
expression which characterize true ,-
poetry and which remain even
when the verse-form is destroyed)

oreta verse. Verse is conceived
of as bound, as shut in within

the limits of the metrical feet “

(cf. r, 10, 59, pedibus . . . claudere

as relaxed (matio soluta is the
technical term3 cl. deisolius, 55;
solvas, 60, below).
