ut tibi si sit opus liquidi nonamplius urna,

, vel cyatho, et dicas, ‘ Magno de flumine mallem

’ “ quam ex hoc fonticulo tantundem sumere) Eo fit,

plenior ut si quos delectet copia iusto,

cum ripa simulavolsos'ferat Aufidus acer ;

at qui tantuli eget quanto est opus is neque limo

turbatam haurit aquam, neque vitam amittit in undis.
Athona pars hominum, decepta cupidine fals0,

54. ut . . . si: just as tf, ‘that

59. The distinction here made

is as if’; to be taken together, not between eget, wants, deseres, and
like ut si, 46, where ut has its opus est, needs, is fundamental to
own verb-liquidi: here, asin the whole argument3 it repeats
so many cases, Horace begins r'ntra’ naturae finis, 49f., and is

“ with the general and advances to
the specific3 liquidi, instead of
aquae, gives a sense like ‘some-
thing 'to drink' So magno de
flurrrine is general, Aufidus, 58,
is specific. - urna: a pinder,
cyath0‚ a gloss, the precise meas-
urements not being in mind here.

55. mallem: I should aare
preferred. The man isthought
i of as standing near the little
spring (notice hoc) and wishing,
= contrary to the fact, that he were
nearariver.

56. fonticulo: diminutive os
contempt, to contrast with magne.

57. plenior. . . iusto: more
than lte ought to haum the whole
sentence must be rendered freely.
-utz with ferat.

58. cum ripa simul: bank and
all. The Aufidus, a rapid river
Ι in Horace's native Apulia, would
undermine its banks in flood time
θ and be turbid with mnd.

uon. san—3

the opposite of plenior si quos
delectet, 57. ’

60. turbatam, vitam amittit:
these ideas merely carry the
thought on into vivid details
which make the folly of the de·
vice more evident, as, in the ’
triumph of using a successful
comparison in argument, one is
easily tempted to carry it be-
yond the likeness. Horace does
not mean that the money of

«the rich man was muddy or

33

‘tainted'3 that thought was not
Roman3 nor is he at this point
thinking of the loss of real
life in over-absorption in busi-
ness. ‹
61. at: to introduce the reply
or counter-argument contained
in vs. 62.-bona pars: like
the English ‘a good many'-
cupidine: masc, as always in
Horace and sometimes in other
writers
